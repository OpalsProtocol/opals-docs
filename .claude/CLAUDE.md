# Opals CEO Operations Guide

## Project Overview

**Opals** is building the infrastructure for fair, sustainable token launches. We're not another launchpad, we're establishing a new primitive for projects to bootstrap communmity with smart contract-enforced commitments.

The Opals method: Create (NFTs) → Sell (Patron Cards) → Launch (Token) → Claim (with vesting & diamond hands)

## Content Strategy Framework

### The Opals Narrative (Core Positioning)

**Problem Statement:**
> "What began as a movement to build durable digital institutions has become obsessed with narratives and quick flips. The memecoin mentality reduced projects to casino chips with hidden allocations, while even the most promising teams get trapped managing token vesting schedules instead of building."

**The Solution (Opals):**
> "Smart contracts should be actual contracts, unbreakable commitments that outlive their creators. Not financial instruments, but digital constitutions issued and enforced by code."

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **LP Allocation to Cards**: Instead of burning LPs, we allocate them to pre-sale cards. Each card owns a permanent share of locked protocol liquidity with 10x PatronPower incentive
2. **Card Ownership = LP Rights**: When you sell a pre-sale card, the new owner automatically inherits the LP allocation. No migrations, no contract interactions required
3. **Permanent Fee Sharing**: Pre-sale card holders share in 1% OpalSwap trading fees forever from their allocated LPs—even after token claim or card sale
4. **PatronPower Economics**: Time commitment creates powerful incentives for long-term holding (1.024x to 10x multipliers across all locked LP sources)
5. **Fixed Supply**: Zero inflation, all rewards from actual 1% trading fees, not token minting—sustainable incentive alignment without dilution
6. **Diamond Vesting**: Early token claimers forfeit tokens to remaining believers. This creates the strongest incentive to hold long-term

### Content Pillars (60/30/10 Rule)

**60% - Thought Leadership & Education**
- Why fair launches matter for crypto sustainability
- Tokenomics best practices
- Community formation and alignment

## Key Messaging Frameworks

### The Problem → Solution → Vision Arc

**PROBLEM**: 99% of Web3 projects fail because they treat tokens like casino chips

**SOLUTION**: Opals enforces fair launches through smart contracts and Patron NFTs

**VISION**: Web3 projects that prioritize community alignment over VC extraction

### The "Presale vs Launchpad Casino" Comparison

| Aspect | Launchpad Casino | Presale (Opals) |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Token allocation | Hidden, VC-friendly | Transparent, community-first |
| NFTs | Afterthought | Pre-requisite (Presale Cards) |
| Vesting | Ignored | Enforced by code |
| Success metric | Token price pump | Sustainable development |
| Alignment | VCs vs community | Community vs extractors |

### The 4-Stage Opals Method

1. **CREATE** - Mint Presale NFTs from day one (community, not tokens)
2. **SELL** - Limited edition Presale cards fundraise for token liquidity
3. **LAUNCH** - When critical mass reached, deploy token on DEX
4. **CLAIM** - Card holders claim vested tokens with diamond hands mechanics

## Opals v2: Core Messaging Framework

### The Opals V2 Story (Updated November 2025)

**What Changed:**
Opals v2 introduces LP tokens as the universal distribution primitive. Instead of distributing tokens directly, everything flows through liquidity pool ownership. This creates mathematically unruggable projects while rewarding long-term commitment. Presale cards get tokens and allocated burnt LPs that earn for the life of the project.

**Key Messages:**

**1. LP Tokens = Real Ownership**
- "Your Presale Card represents permanent liquidity ownership, not just token allocation"
- "When liquidity is locked forever, rug pulls become economically irrational"
- "Trading fees flow to liquidity owners. Real revenue, not token inflation"

**2. PatronPower = Time Over Capital**
-   Locked LPs represent patronage. So instead of getting rid of or locking the LPs, we allocate it to the people with the pre-sale. And then we let people who missed out on the pre-sale also lock their LPs. The longer they lock, the more patron power they get. 

**3. Fixed Supply = Sustainable Economics**
- "Zero inflation. All rewards from protocol fees"
- "1 billion tokens minted once. No minting function exists"
- "Your percentage of supply stays constant forever"

**4. Fee Distribution = Real Yield**
- "1% trading fees on OpalSwap distributed to PatronPower holders"
- "4% NFT sale fees: Equal split between Creator, Protocol, and Referrers"
- "Stake USDC in WorkLock → Aave interest → Auto-zapped to LP tokens"
- "Revenue scales with usage, not with dilution"

**5. OpalSwap = Opals' Custom DEX**
- "Proprietary DEX with built-in zap functionality"
- "Deposit ETH or USDC → Automatically creates 50/50 LP → Earn fees"
- "Fee on output token: Accumulate tokens when price rising, ETH when falling"
- "Each project token gets its own LP pair on OpalSwap"
- "One-click liquidity provision eliminates multi-step complexity"

**6. Five Participation Paths**
- "Member Card: Free for early community (10x PatronPower)"
- "Supporter Card: Earned via contributions (10x PatronPower)"
- "Patron Card: Purchased with ETH during sale (10x PatronPower, permanent)"
- "Vault Card: Stake LP post-launch (1.024x to 10x based on duration)"
- "Lock Card: Deposit USDC in WorkLock (liquid, risk-free, earn from Aave interest)"

### Technical Accuracy Checklist

When creating content about Opals v2, ensure:

✅ **DO say:**
- "OpalSwap" (not "Uniswap V2" or generic "DEX")
- "Fixed supply" (not "low inflation")
- "Vault Card / Lock Card / Patron Card" (specific card types)
- "Zap functionality" (auto-balance to LP)

❌ **DON'T say:**
- "Token rewards from staking" (implies inflation)
- "Transfer tax" (implies tax on transfers, it's a fee on swaps)
- "Timelock" (implies temporary, locks are permanent)
- "VC-backed" (community-funded is the whole point)
- "High APY from staking" (without specifying fee-based, not inflationary)

### Narrative Angles for v2


**The PatronPower Economics:**
> "Crypto incentivizes capital. Opals incentivizes conviction. A small holder who commits permanently earns more than a whale who commits for a week. The time-based incentive structure creates a 10x advantage for true believers. Mercenary capital becomes economically pointless."

**The Fixed Supply Sustainability:**
> "Token inflation is not sustainable. Early stakers earn from late staker dilution. Opals pays rewards from protocol fees, real revenue from real trading activity. If volume drops, APR adjusts honestly. If volume grows, rewards compound. Sustainable tokenomics."

**The Diamond Vesting Mechanism:**
> "Claim early, forfeit tokens to remaining holders. Wait full vesting, earn your allocation plus share of forfeited tokens. The weak hands subsidize the diamond hands. Alignment through economic design."

**The OpalSwap Innovation:**
> "Building a DEX? No. We needed liquidity infrastructure that enforces fairness by design. OpalSwap's zap functionality means anyone can provide liquidity with one transaction, deposit ETH, automatically balanced to 50/50 LP. No arbitrage hunters. No impermanent loss calculations. Just one-click participation."

**The Three-Tier Access Model:**
> "Patron Cards for true believers (permanent, 10x). Vault Cards for flexible participants (time-locked, 1.024x to 10x). Lock Cards for passive supporters (USDC deposits, liquid). Three ways to participate. One aligned ecosystem. Everyone earns based on commitment."

**The 20/80 Economics:**
> "When you raise funds, 80% goes to liquidity. Forever. No unlock date. No governance vote to change it. The smart contract guarantees deep, permanent liquidity. Projects keep 20% for operations. That's all they need. That's all they get."

**The Fee Direction Advantage:**
> "OpalSwap takes 1% on the output token. Buy pressure? Holders accumulate more tokens. Sell pressure? Holders accumulate ETH instead. Either way, PatronPower holders benefit. The DEX itself becomes a natural accumulation strategy, tokens on the way up, stable assets on the way down."

**The Five-Path Model:**
> "Be early, get a free Member Card. Build value, earn a Supporter Card. Invest funds, buy a Patron Card. Join later, stake LP in a Vault Card. Want safety, deposit USDC for a Lock Card. Five ways to participate. Everyone aligned. All rewarded by PatronPower."

### Comparison Messaging (Updated for v2)


**vs. PumpFun/Memecoin Launch:**
| Them | Opals v2 |
|------|----------|
| Token tradable day 1 | NFTs first, token later |
| No community before launch | Community builds during presale |
| Whale/bot dominance | Presale + Vesting |
| Dump and abandon | Diamond vesting alignment |
| No sustainable revenue | 1% fee perpetual income |

**vs. VC Fundraising:**
| Them | Opals v2 |
|------|----------|
| Exit pressure (3-5 years) | No exit timeline |
| Community is users | Community is owners |

### Hot Takes for v2 Content

- "PatronPower: The first crypto economic system where time beats money."
- "Your token has a minting function? That's a dilution function."
- "OpalSwap: One transaction to provide liquidity. Because complexity serves extractors, not users."
- "80% locked, 20% operational. If you need more than that, you're extracting, not building."
- "Fee on output token: Holders earn what's being bought. Tokens on the way up. ETH on the way down."
- "Five cards. Five paths. One rule: More commitment = More rewards."
- "Member Cards are free. Supporter Cards are earned. Patron Cards are bought. All get 10x PatronPower."
- "Cards track ownership. Users trade cards. LP rights move with the card. No user migration needed."
- "One form. One transaction. Nine contracts. 74.7% cheaper. Immutable from day one. This is Opals Recipe."
- "If your contracts are upgradeable, they're not trustless. Immutability is the only guarantee."

- "Tally.xyz + Opal Cards = On-chain governance without custom development. Ship governance on day one."

### Response Templates

**When someone asks "How do you make money?"**
> "4% fee on Patron Card sales, split equally: 25% to creator (immediate runway), 25% to protocol, 25% each to referrers. Plus 1% trading fees on OpalSwap distributed to PatronPower holders. We're aligned with project success through participation, not extraction."

**When someone asks "Why LP tokens?"**
> "LP tokens prove liquidity exists and can't be rugged. Traditional token airdrops can be dumped immediately. LP ownership means you earn from every trade, forever. It's ownership, not speculation. And with OpalSwap's zap, creating LP takes one transaction."

**When someone asks "What if I need liquidity?"**
> "Three options based on your commitment: 1) Patron Cards are tradeable NFTs on OpenSea, sell anytime, economic rights transfer. 2) Vault Cards with flexible duration (7 days to 4 years). 3) Lock Cards (WorkLock) with liquid USDC principal. We provide flexibility without compromising the system."

**When someone asks "Isn't this complicated?"**
> "Complex system, simple UX. Founders: Fill form, deploy, sell cards, 80% goes to liquidity automatically. Investors: Buy Patron Card, or stake LP in Vault, or deposit USDC in WorkLock. The smart contracts handle everything else. You don't need to understand PatronPower math to benefit from it."

**When someone asks "What's OpalSwap?"**
> "Our custom DEX with built-in zap functionality. Deposit ETH or USDC, it automatically swaps 50% for the project token and creates LP. One transaction instead of five. Plus 1% trading fees go to PatronPower holders, not Uniswap LPs."

**When someone asks "How is this different from X launchpad?"**
> "80% of funds locked in liquidity forever vs their 6-month timelocks. Threshold-triggered launches (guaranteed minimum liquidity) vs arbitrary dates. Five participation tiers (Member/Supporter/Patron/Vault/Lock Cards) vs one-size-fits-all. Fee-based rewards vs inflationary tokenomics. We built infrastructure for projects to survive, not platforms to extract."

**When someone asks "How hard is deployment?"**
> "Fill one form. Click submit. One transaction. Nine contracts deployed, initialized, and connected. Opals Recipe wrapper clones templates via EIP-1167. 74.7% cheaper than custom deployment. 5 minutes vs 8+ weeks. Immutable from day one, no admin keys, no upgrades."

**When someone asks "What about governance?"**
> "All Opal Cards will integrate with Tally.xyz. Card ownership = voting power weighted by PatronPower. On-chain proposals for treasury allocation. Industry-standard UI, no custom development needed. Planned, not live yet."

**When someone asks "Can I build on top of Opals?"**
> "Yes. Add integratorAddress to marketplace buy transactions. Automatically receive portion of 4% market fees. Build custom frontends, niche integrations, whitelabel solutions. We enable the ecosystem, capture value through protocol fees."
