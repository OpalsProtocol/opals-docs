# How Opals Works

Most token launches fail because they get the order wrong. Token first, community later. Price discovery before product-market fit. Speculation before utility. By the time founders realize they've built a community of mercenary capital instead of committed believers, it's too late.

Opals reverses this sequence. Community first. Cards before tokens. Commitment before claims. The system operates in four phases, each triggering automatically based on verifiable on-chain conditions, not founder promises.

## Deploy: Five Minutes to Live Ecosystem

Fill out a form. Token name, supply, card pricing strategy, capital allocation split. Click deploy. Nine interconnected smart contracts clone from battle-tested templates using EIP-1167 minimal proxies.

Every parameter you set during deployment becomes immutable. Token supply cannot increase. The 80/20 liquidity split cannot change. No admin keys exist to modify these rules later. This isn't a limitation, it's a feature. Immutability prevents the rug pulls that plague every other launch mechanism.

## Sell: Cards Accumulate Capital

Your market opens. Community members purchase Patron Cards, paying ETH for NFTs that represent permanent liquidity ownership. Each card carries allocation rights to tokens plus locked LP shares that generate trading fee rewards forever.

The sale continues until you reach your capital threshold. This might take hours for projects with strong community or weeks for longer campaigns. Every ETH raised splits automatically: 20% to project treasury for operational runway, 80% to permanent liquidity that cannot be withdrawn. Ever. By anyone. The smart contract enforces this split, not governance votes or founder integrity.

## Launch: Threshold Triggers Automation

When accumulated capital hits your preset threshold, the Launcher executes automatically. Takes the 80% allocated to liquidity. Zaps it through OpalSwap's one-click LP creation. Swaps half the ETH for project tokens. Creates a 50/50 liquidity pool. Locks the resulting LP tokens permanently in claim contracts.

Token now trades on OpalSwap. Initial price determined purely by mathematics: ETH in pool divided by tokens in pool. No price manipulation. No insider access. Just immediate market discovery from the moment launch occurs.

## Earn: Perpetual Fee Distribution

Every trade on OpalSwap pays a 1% fee. These fees flow to the Distributor contract and accumulate continuously. Card holders claim their share anytime based on PatronPower, the time-weighted commitment multiplier that ranges from 1.024x for seven-day locks to 10x for permanent commitment.

A supporter with one thousand dollars locked permanently earns more than a whale with forty-one thousand locked for seven days. Time defeats capital. Conviction compounds. This mathematical reality prevents mercenary capital from dominating reward distribution while ensuring committed supporters earn proportionally to their belief.

The system runs itself. You deploy once. The contracts handle everything else. No token management. No liquidity decisions. No vesting schedules to track manually. Just code executing exactly as specified, forever.
