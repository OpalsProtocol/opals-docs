### Opals Method

We see capital formation as a 4-stage process over time:

#### Create - Mint and distribute digital assets from day one
- **Collectables, not points** to community / team / advisors based on contributions
- **NFT-based system** allows for granular tokenomics later
- **Community building** through digital asset ownership
- **Early engagement** without token speculation

#### Sell - Limited edition Patron Cards to raise capital towards token liquidity
- **Stepped pricing** rewards early supporters
- **Transparent process** with clear pricing tiers
- **Community validation** through member markets
- **Anti-bot protection** through innovative mechanisms

#### Launch - When communities reach critical mass, patron sales accumulate, eventually launching a token when a set price cap is reached
- **Automatic token launch** when funding targets are met
- **Permanent liquidity locks** prevent rug pulls
- **Fair distribution** based on card ownership
- **Immediate tradability** on OpalSwap

#### Claim - Card holders, both contributors and patrons, can claim tokens over a set vesting period, with diamond hand mechanics
- **Linear vesting** with early claim penalties
- **Diamond hand rewards** for long-term holders
- **Community benefits** from early exits
- **Sustainable tokenomics** without inflation


### Architecture

#### Market Mechanisms
- **Stepped Markets**: Fair launch standard with transparent pricing
- **Linear Markets**: Linear price discovery for flexible contributions
- **Members Markets**: Community-first with vouching system
- **Key Markets**: Access control based on Card ownership

#### PatronPower Algorithm
- **Mathematical foundation** for reward distribution
- **Time-based multipliers** from 1.024x to 10x
- **Commitment bonuses** for early supporters
- **Card multipliers** for different card types

#### Anti-Rug Pull Mechanisms
- **Permanent liquidity locks** with no admin keys
- **Transparent tokenomics** visible before launch
- **Community control** over token distribution
- **Penalty redistribution** to diamond hands

#### Template Factory Pattern
- **95% gas savings** through EIP-1167 minimal proxy pattern
- **Battle-tested templates** deployed once and cloned
- **Configuration-based** setup instead of custom deployments
- **Upgradeable master contracts** through governance

## Economic Innovation

### Non-Inflationary Farming

Traditional farming creates new tokens to pay rewards, diluting existing holders. Opals creates sustainable yield from real trading fees:

- **Real Revenue**: 1% trading fees on all swaps
- **Sustainable Growth**: Rewards scale with trading volume
- **No Dilution**: Existing holders are never diluted
- **Fair Distribution**: Everyone benefits from real value creation

### Open Vested Liquidity (OVL)

Traditional vesting is binary - lock or nothing. OVL provides flexibility with fairness:

- **Flexible Exits**: Exit anytime with predictable penalties
- **Penalty Redistribution**: Early exits benefit long-term holders
- **Aligned Incentives**: Long-term holders are rewarded
- **Sustainable Model**: Reduces selling pressure

### Diamond Hand Vesting

Reward long-term commitment while providing flexibility:

- **One Claim Per Card**: Prevents multiple claims
- **Early Claim Penalties**: Forfeited tokens redistributed
- **Community Benefits**: Early exits benefit remaining holders
- **Strong Incentives**: Encourages long-term holding

## Conclusion

Ethereum enabled this future - Opals delivers it.

We're not just building another launchpad. We're creating the infrastructure for a new kind of internet - one where communities own their platforms, where early supporters become permanent stakeholders, and where the incentives of projects and their communities are perfectly aligned.

The future of community-owned projects is here. Welcome to Opals Protocol.
