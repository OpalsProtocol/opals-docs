# Token Launcher

Here's the problem every angel investor faces: you invest in a project, the project raises capital, and then... nothing. Maybe the team gets distracted. Maybe they decide the timing isn't right. Maybe they just never launch the token at all. Your money is gone, the promises were made, but there's no guarantee any of it happens.

The Launcher changes this completely. It's a smart contract that guarantees token launch when a capital threshold is met. Not when the founders feel like it. Not when market conditions are perfect. Not when governance votes approve it. When the threshold is hit, the token launches. Automatically. Trustlessly. Immutably.

This is why it matters: you need to know that when you buy a Presale Card, your capital isn't just funding operations or paying salaries. It's directly contributing to the token launch itself. With Opals, card sale proceeds flow to the Launcher, enforced by the smart contracts from day one.

The Launcher accumulates capital from card sales and holds 20% of the project's token. When it hits the configured target, maybe $100K, maybe $5M, whatever the project set at deployment, it automatically combines the accumulated capital with the token allocation and creates the liquidity pool on OpalSwap. The initial token price is set by the ratio of capital to tokens. Trading begins immediately. 

This could take months. It could take years. But you know with certainty that if enough cards are sold to meet the threshold, the token will launch. Not "probably will launch" or "should launch eventually" or "we promise to launch." Will launch. The contract enforces it.

This solves the trust problem that plagues token presales. Projects raise money and promise future tokens, but there's no enforcement mechanism. Founders can delay indefinitely, change terms, or abandon the project entirely. With the Launcher, the commitment is on-chain from day one. Every card sale brings the project closer to the threshold. Hit the threshold, launch happens. It's that simple.

The Launcher also connects directly to claim contracts. Projects can configure their Presale Claim and Vault Claim contracts to remain locked until the Launcher executes. This means Card holders can't claim tokens until sufficient liquidity exists. No claims before launch. No distribution without trading. Everything is synchronized automatically by the smart contracts.

Even better: the Launcher accepts capital from any source, not just card sales. If believers want to contribute directly to push the project over the threshold, they can. If additional revenue sources exist, they can flow to the Launcher. Every dollar brings the launch closer to reality, and everyone can see exactly how close the project is to the threshold at any time.

When you buy a Presale Card on Opals, you're not trusting founders to eventually launch a token. You're locking in a guarantee: if this project raises enough capital to meet its threshold, the token will launch. The Launcher ensures it. No dev required.
