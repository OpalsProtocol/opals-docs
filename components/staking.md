# Staking

Staking is how you earn rewards. It's the mechanism that transforms idle tokens into income-generating assets.

In Opals, staking means locking your LP tokens. LP tokens represent your share of the liquidity pool. When you stake them, you earn PatronPower. PatronPower determines your share of trading fees.

Staking is flexible. You can lock for as little as 7 days or as long as 4 years. You can also choose permanent locks for maximum rewards.

The longer you lock, the more PatronPower you earn. Seven-day locks earn 0.024x multiplier. One-year locks earn 1.25x multiplier. Four-year locks earn 5x multiplier. Permanent locks earn 10x multiplier.

This creates a 416x difference between minimum and maximum commitment. A whale staking $1 million for 7 days earns less PatronPower than a small holder staking $1,000 permanently.

Staking prevents mercenary capital. Short-term plays become economically pointless. Long-term commitment becomes the most profitable strategy.

Staking is permissionless. No approval needed. No KYC required. Just connect your wallet and stake. The smart contracts handle everything.

Staking creates community. People who stake long-term become invested in the project's success. They want it to succeed because they benefit from its success.

Staking is also tradeable. You can sell your staked position as an NFT. This provides liquidity while maintaining the economic incentives.

The staking mechanism creates sustainable growth. It rewards genuine supporters. It prevents speculation. It builds lasting communities.

Staking transforms tokens from speculative assets into income-generating assets. You don't just hope for price appreciation. You earn real revenue from actual usage.

This creates a new kind of investment. Not just buying and holding, but actively participating in the project's success. Not just hoping for the best, but earning from the best.
