# Claims

Claims are how you receive your tokens. They're the bridge between Patron Cards and actual ownership.

When a project launches, Patron Card holders can claim their token allocation. The claiming process is simple. Connect your wallet. Click claim. Receive your tokens.

But there's a catch. You can only claim once. This creates a strategic decision. Claim early and get some tokens now. Wait longer and get more tokens later.

This is the Diamond Hand mechanism. Early claims forfeit unvested tokens. These forfeited tokens get redistributed to remaining holders. The longer you wait, the more you receive.

The math is transparent. If you claim at 30% vesting, you forfeit 70% of your allocation. If you claim at 80% vesting, you forfeit 20%. If you wait until 100% vesting, you forfeit nothing.

This creates strong incentives for long-term holding. The community benefits from early exits. Diamond hands get rewarded for patience.

Claims are permissionless. No admin approval needed. No KYC required. Just connect your wallet and claim. The smart contracts handle everything.

The claiming process is gas-efficient. Batch claiming is supported. You can claim multiple cards in one transaction. This reduces costs and improves user experience.

Claims create finality. Once you claim, the process is complete. No ongoing obligations. No additional steps. You own your tokens outright.

This simplicity is intentional. Complex claiming processes create friction. Friction reduces participation. Simple processes increase adoption.

Claims also create community dynamics. Watching others claim creates social pressure. But the economic incentives encourage patience. This balance creates healthy community behavior.

The goal is clear: make claiming easy, make waiting rewarding, make the community stronger.
