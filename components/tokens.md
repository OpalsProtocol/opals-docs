# Tokens

The memecoin era taught us one lesson: tokens launched too early become casino chips. Every project rushing to "launch token" before building community, before demonstrating value, before anyone even knows what the project does. Then they wonder why price dumps, why community disappears, why only mercenary capital remains.

Opals reverses this. Cards first. Distribution second. Token third. By the time the token launches, you already know who your supporters are, what they contributed, and how committed they'll be long-term. The token isn't the start of the journeyvit's the reward for completing it.

## Why Tokens Come Last

Traditional launches put tokens first. Airdrop to KOLs. Hope they stick around and tweet about the project. Watch them dump on day one. The incentive structure punishes patience, community building and rewards extraction.

Opals puts tokens last in the sequence: Create Cards -> Distribute Cards -> Launch Token -> Claim with Vesting. By launch day, everyone who holds Presale Cards, Membership Cards, or Contributor Cards has already proven themselves. They joined early. They built value. They committed capital. They know what they earnt, when they earnt it and how much they earnt. The token becomes the culmination of that commitment, not the beginning of speculation at TGE.

This creates natural filtering. Bots can't farm Membership Cards without participating in the community. KOLs can't earn Contributor Cards without doing actual work. By the time token claims open, the holder base is already aligned with the project's long-term success.

## Fixed Supply, Real Rewards

One billion tokens. Minted once. No minting function exists in the contract. Your percentage of supply stays constant forever.

Most projects promise high APY from staking, then print new tokens to pay those rewards. This is inflation masquerading as yield. Everyone gets 20% more tokens, supply inflates 20%, real value stays flat. It's a mathematical shell game that eventually collapses.

Opals rewards come from protocol fees, not token inflation. The 1% trading fees collected by OpalSwap flow to PatronPower holders as actual revenue. If trading volume grows, rewards grow. If volume falls, rewards fall proportionally. This honesty protects the ecosystem from fake yields and unsustainable promises.

Fixed supply means your tokens maintain their percentage of the total forever. No dilution. No inflation. No future governance vote that changes the rules. The supply cap is immutable, encoded in the smart contract from day one.

## Distribution Through Cards

Tokens distribute to three card types: Presale Cards purchased during fundraising, Membership Cards claimed by early community, and Contributor Cards earned through building value. Each card represents a specific token allocation that vests over time.

When you hold a Presale Card, you're entitled to claim tokens according to the vesting schedule. Claim early when only 25% has vested, and you forfeit the remaining 75% to other holders who wait. Claim at full vesting, and you receive your complete allocation plus bonuses from those who claimed early.

This diamond hand vesting mechanism creates economic incentives for long-term holding. The weak hands subsidize the strong hands. Patience becomes profitable. Conviction compounds.

## Productive Assets, Not Speculation

Tokens aren't meant for speculation. They're meant for productivity. Stake them in Vault Cards to earn PatronPower rewards. Provide liquidity on OpalSwap to earn trading fees. Hold them to participate in governance. The token has utility beyond price appreciation.

The token launch happens when the Launcher threshold is met. Not on an arbitrary calendar date, not when founders feel ready, but when enough capital commits to guarantee deep, permanent liquidity. This threshold-triggered model ensures every token launches with sufficient liquidity to support healthy price discovery.

Once launched, tokens trade on OpalSwap with 1% fees flowing back to PatronPower holders. This creates a feedback loop: more trading generates more fees, more fees reward committed holders, committed holders support the project long-term, project success drives more trading.

Tokens are the final piece of the Opals mechanism. Not the beginning, the culmination. Not casino chips, productive assets that generate real yield from real protocol activity.
