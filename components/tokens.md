# Tokens

Tokens are the lifeblood of any crypto project. They represent value, governance rights, and economic incentives.

In Opals, tokens serve multiple purposes. They're the medium of exchange in trading pairs. They're the reward for long-term commitment. They're the governance mechanism for community decisions.

Token distribution happens through Patron Cards. Each card type gets a different allocation. Patron Cards receive 60-80% of total supply. Member Cards get 10-20%. Contributor Cards earn 5-15%. Team Cards hold 5-10%.

The distribution is transparent and immutable. Everyone knows the rules from day one. No hidden allocations. No surprise dilutions. The math is locked in smart contracts.

Tokens vest over time. Patron Cards typically vest over 4 years. Member Cards over 2 years. Contributor Cards over 1 year. This creates long-term alignment between holders and project success.

The vesting is linear. No cliffs, no sudden unlocks. Smooth, predictable distribution that prevents market shocks.

Trading fees flow back to token holders. Every swap generates revenue. This revenue gets distributed proportionally based on PatronPower. The more committed you are, the more you earn.

This creates a sustainable economic model. Token holders don't just hope for price appreciation. They earn real revenue from actual usage. The more the project succeeds, the more everyone benefits.

Tokens become more than just speculative assets. They become income-generating assets tied to real value creation.
