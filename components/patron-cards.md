# Patron Cards

Patron Cards are digital ownership certificates. They represent your stake in a project's future success.

When you buy a Patron Card, you're not just purchasing art. You're buying a claim on the project's liquidity pool. This claim is permanent. It cannot be removed or diluted.

Each Patron Card entitles you to a specific amount of LP tokens. These LP tokens represent your fractional ownership of the ETH-Token pair on Uniswap. As trading happens and fees accumulate, your LP value grows.

The beauty is in the permanence. Once allocated, these LP tokens are locked forever. The project can never remove liquidity. Neither can you withdraw the underlying tokens directly. But you earn from every trade forever.

Patron Cards come in different rarities. Legendary cards (first 100) earn higher multipliers. Epic cards (101-500) get priority access. Rare cards (501-1000) receive community perks. Common cards (1001+) get standard rewards.

This isn't speculation. It's ownership. You become a permanent stakeholder in projects you believe in.

The cards are fully transferable. You can sell them on secondary markets. But the economic rights stay with the card. Whoever holds the card controls the rewards.

This creates a new kind of community. Not temporary supporters, but permanent stakeholders. People who benefit from the project's long-term success, not just short-term price movements.
