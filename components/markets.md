# Markets

Markets are where Patron Cards get sold. They determine pricing, access, and community dynamics.

Opals offers three market types. Each serves different project needs and community goals.

Stepped Markets are the most popular. Cards sell in batches with increasing prices. Early supporters get better deals. Latecomers pay more. This creates FOMO while rewarding commitment. The first 100 cards might cost 0.1 ETH each. The next 200 cost 0.25 ETH. The final 200 cost 0.5 ETH.

Fixed Markets offer predictable pricing. Everyone pays the same price. First-come, first-served. Simple and fair, but less exciting. Best for established projects with strong communities.

Members Markets require vouching. Existing members vouch for new participants. This creates a web of trust. Bots can't participate. Only genuine community members get access. Perfect for exclusive launches.

The market type affects community psychology. Stepped Markets create urgency and momentum. Fixed Markets feel fair and democratic. Members Markets feel exclusive and curated.

Pricing is transparent. No hidden fees. No surprise costs. The rules are clear from the start. This builds trust and prevents manipulation.

Markets also determine access. Some projects want broad participation. Others prefer curated communities. The market type reflects the project's philosophy.

The goal is always the same: fair distribution to genuine supporters. The method varies based on project needs and community goals.

Markets create the initial community. The people who buy Patron Cards become the project's core supporters. They have skin in the game. They want the project to succeed.

This isn't just fundraising. It's community building. Every sale creates a new stakeholder. Every stakeholder becomes an advocate.
