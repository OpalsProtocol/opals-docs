# Distributor

Most projects promise you rewards from token inflation. Print new tokens, distribute them to stakers, call it yield. But this is just moving value from one pocket to another, diluting everyone to reward everyone. When supply doubles, your percentage halves. The math doesn't lie even when the marketing does.

The Distributor solves this with brutal honesty: rewards come from real revenue, not printed tokens. Every swap on OpalSwap pays a 1% fee. That fee flows into the Distributor contract. The Distributor accumulates these fees and distributes them to Card holders based on their PatronPower. No inflation. No dilution. Just real trading activity creating real rewards.

## Why the Distributor Matters

Token inflation creates fake yields that attract mercenary capital. When the inflation stops, the capital leaves, and the token price collapses. We've seen this cycle destroy project after project. The yields were never real, they were just accounting tricks that delayed the inevitable.

Fee-based distribution is different. If trading volume is high, rewards are high. If volume drops, rewards drop proportionally. This honesty protects the ecosystem. Projects can't hide behind fake APYs. The Distributor's yield reflects actual usage, actual demand, actual value creation.

This creates powerful alignment. Card holders want the project to succeed not because it pumps the token price, but because success means more trading volume, which means more fees, which means more rewards. You're not betting on speculation. You're invested in actual utility.

## How It Works

When someone swaps tokens on OpalSwap, 1% of the trade goes to the Distributor. If someone trades $100,000 worth of tokens, $1,000 flows into the contract. These fees accumulate continuously, hourly, daily, constantly. Your share is calculated based on your PatronPower relative to total PatronPower across all participants.

Hold 1% of total PatronPower, earn 1% of accumulated fees. Not approximately, not eventually, but exactly and automatically. The smart contract calculates your share down to the smallest unit the blockchain can measure. No human intermediary. No governance vote. Just mathematical precision that can't be gamed or corrupted.

Claiming is permissionless. Call the claim function whenever you want. Gas costs a few dollars on mainnet, pennies on Layer 2. When your accumulated rewards exceed gas costs, claiming becomes profitable. Some claim daily. Some monthly. Some annually. The choice is yours because the rewards are yours, accumulated fairly, distributed mathematically, claimable whenever convenient.

## Real Revenue, Real Yields

A project with $10 million in daily trading volume generates $100,000 daily in fees. That's $3 million monthly, $36 million yearly. Not promises. Not projected inflation. Actual fees from actual trades distributed to actual supporters.

Your rewards scale with the project's success. Small early supporters with permanent locks earn disproportionately. A whale with short-term commitment earns less per dollar invested. Time beats capital. Conviction beats size. The Distributor's PatronPower weighting ensures this.

Unlike inflation-based staking where APY means nothing (everyone gets diluted equally), fee-based yields mean everything. 20% APY from fees means trading generated 20% of locked value in actual revenue. That's real return, not accounting fiction.

## The Permanent Incentive

Traditional staking rewards end when incentives run out. Projects launch with high APYs to attract capital, then yields collapse when inflation stops. The Distributor never stops. As long as people trade, which is to say, as long as the token exists, fees flow to Card holders.

This creates a permanent income stream for permanent supporters. Your Presale Card with 10x PatronPower doesn't just earn you tokens through vesting. It earns you a share of every trade, forever. Even after you claim your tokens, the Card keeps earning. This is ownership, not speculation.

The Distributor is the engine that makes long-term holding rational. It transforms Cards from tickets to future tokens into productive assets that generate yield today, tomorrow, and for as long as the project exists. This is how you build communities that don't exit the moment tokens unlock.
