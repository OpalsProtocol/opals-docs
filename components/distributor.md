# Distributor

The Distributor is the reward engine. It collects trading fees and distributes them to Patron Card holders.

Every time someone trades a project's token, a 1% fee is charged. This fee doesn't disappear. It flows to the Distributor contract. The Distributor accumulates these fees over time.

Distribution happens based on PatronPower. PatronPower is calculated from your stake size and commitment duration. The more you stake and the longer you lock, the more PatronPower you earn.

The distribution is proportional. If you have 10% of total PatronPower, you receive 10% of accumulated fees. If you have 1% of PatronPower, you receive 1% of fees.

This creates a sustainable reward model. Rewards come from actual usage, not token inflation. The more people trade, the more everyone earns. The more the project succeeds, the more the community benefits.

Distribution is automatic. You don't need to manually claim rewards. They accumulate in your account. You can claim anytime, but there's no penalty for waiting.

The Distributor is immutable. No one can change the distribution rules. No one can take your rewards. The math is locked in smart contracts.

This creates long-term alignment. Patron Card holders want the project to succeed because they benefit from its success. Not through price appreciation, but through actual revenue generation.

The Distributor also prevents mercenary capital. Short-term stakers earn almost nothing. Long-term stakers earn exponentially more. This makes genuine commitment the most profitable strategy.

Distribution creates community. Everyone benefits from the project's success. This creates positive network effects. More success leads to more rewards leads to more commitment.

The Distributor is the heart of the economic model. It transforms speculation into ownership. It creates sustainable incentives. It builds lasting communities.
