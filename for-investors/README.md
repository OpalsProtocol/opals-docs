# For Investors

Buy early-stage projects. Earn rewards that scale with commitment. No rug pulls. No insider deals. Transparent on-chain mechanics.

## The Three Pages You Need

**[Getting Started](./getting-started.md)** (2k words)
What you're buying, wallet setup, first purchase, lock durations, how to earn.

**[Strategy & Risk](./strategy-and-risk.md)** (3k words)
Locking strategies, portfolio structure, risk management, when to exit.

**[For Founders](../for-founders/README.md)** (reference)
Share with projects you invest in - shows them what you're looking for.

## What You're Earning

**Three income streams**:
1. **LP Trading Fees**: 1% of all swaps (vs 0.3% standard Uniswap)
2. **Reward Tokens**: Projects distribute to early supporters
3. **Price Appreciation**: If token goes up, your LP value increases

## Lock Durations

| Duration | Multiplier | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| 7 days | 0.024x | Test it |
| 1 year | 1.25x | Moderate belief |
| Permanent | 10x | Diamond hands |

Permanent lock earns **416x more** than 7-day lock (same capital).

## Opals' Guarantees ✅

- **Rug-proof**: LP locked permanently, no withdrawal function exists
- **Bot-proof**: Stepped pricing eliminates first-mover advantage
- **Fair**: Everyone in same batch pays same price
- **Transparent**: All economics on-chain, immutable

## Risks You Still Face ⚠️

- **Market price volatility**: Tokens can drop 50%+
- **Project execution**: Team might not deliver
- **Your own mistakes**: Over-allocating, panic selling

**How to protect**: Start small ($500-1k), diversify 3-5 projects, only permanent-lock what you'd hold 5 years

## Core Strategy

1. **Research 3-5 projects** you genuinely believe in
2. **Lock 30-90 days** on new projects (test them)
3. **Extend to permanent** after validation (6+ months monitoring)
4. **Diversify** - no more than 20% per project
5. **Compound** - reinvest rewards to grow PatronPower

## Quick Math Example

**Your investment**: 1 ETH Patron Card at launch
**Project raises**: 100 ETH total
**Your LP allocation**: 1% of pool (locked forever)
**Daily trading volume**: $10M
**1% trading fee**: $100k daily
**Your share** (1% PatronPower, permanent): ~$50/day = $18,250/year

(Real returns vary. This assumes continued volume and permanent lock)

**Remember**: You eliminate rug pull risk by using Opals. You don't eliminate market risk. Smart investing means backing good teams, committing long-term, and diversifying.
