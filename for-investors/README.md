**Reward calculation**: Transparent, immutable formulas. Your PatronPower = LP Amount × Time Multiplier.

## Investment Stages

### Stage 1: Discovery (Before Launch)

**What happens**: Project conducts Patron Card sale to raise funds.

**Your opportunity**: Buy Patron Cards at stepped prices. Early batches get better pricing.

**Risk level**: Highest. Project may not reach minimum threshold.

**Timeline**: Typically 1-2 weeks.

**Action**: Research project, assess team, determine allocation, buy Patron Cards.

[Getting started guide](./getting-started.md) →

### Stage 2: Launch (Threshold Reached)

**What happens**: Project reaches minimum raise. Liquidity automatically deploys to Uniswap.

**Your opportunity**: You now hold LP tokens representing permanent liquidity share.

**Risk level**: Medium. Token price determined by market.

**Timeline**: Immediate after threshold.

**Action**: Decide whether to hold LP tokens or stake for multiplied rewards.

### Stage 3: Trading (Post-Launch)

**What happens**: Token trades on Opals' custom Uniswap V2 fork. Every trade generates 1% fees (not the standard 0.3%) that go to the Distributor for PatronPower-weighted distribution.

**Your opportunity**: Earn trading fees based on your PatronPower. Stake for additional multiplier rewards.

**Risk level**: Market-dependent. Price volatility normal.

**Timeline**: Ongoing.

**Action**: Monitor performance, claim rewards, compound or reinvest.

### Stage 4: Maturity (Established Project)

**What happens**: Project delivers on roadmap. Community grows. Volume increases.

**Your opportunity**: Accumulated LP fees + staking rewards create sustainable yield.

**Risk level**: Lower. Proven track record reduces uncertainty.

**Timeline**: 6-12 months post-launch.

**Action**: Evaluate continued holding vs reallocation to new opportunities.

## Risk Assessment

All investments carry risk. Opals eliminates rug pull risk but cannot eliminate all risks.

**Protected risks** (eliminated by Opals):
- Rug pulls: Impossible. LP locked permanently.
- Admin theft: Impossible. No admin keys.
- Unfair pricing: Eliminated. Transparent batch pricing.

**Market risks** (still present):
- Token price volatility
- Project execution failure
- Market conditions
- Regulatory changes

**Mitigation strategies**: Diversify across projects. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Research teams thoroughly. Start small.

## How Returns Work

Your returns come from three sources:

### 1. LP Fee Income

Opals uses a custom Uniswap V2 fork with 1% trading fees (not the standard 0.3%). Fees go to the Distributor contract for PatronPower-weighted distribution.

**Example**: $1M daily volume = $10,000 daily fees. If you own 1% of total PatronPower = $100 daily = $36,500 annually.

**Factor**: Trading volume. More volume = more fees.

### 2. Protocol Fee Distribution

Projects distribute protocol fees to stakers based on PatronPower.

**Example**: Project generates $10,000 monthly in protocol fees. You have 5% of total PatronPower = $500 monthly.

**Factor**: Your PatronPower multiplier. Permanent locks earn 10x more than 7-day locks.

### 3. Token Price Appreciation

Your LP tokens contain both ETH and project tokens. If token price rises, your LP value increases.

**Example**: You hold LP worth $10,000 at launch. Token 5x. Your LP now worth approximately $22,360.

**Factor**: Market performance and project execution.

**Note**: Impermanent loss applies. If token price crashes, LP value decreases more than just holding tokens.

## Investment Strategies

### Conservative: LP Holder

Buy Patron Cards. Hold LP tokens. Earn trading fees. No additional staking.

**Pros**: Maximum liquidity. Can sell LP anytime. Simple.

**Cons**: No PatronPower multiplier. No protocol fee rewards.

**Best for**: Risk-averse investors wanting flexibility.

### Moderate: Time-Locked Staking

Buy Patron Cards. Stake LP with 1-2 year lock. Earn 1.25x-2.5x multiplier.

**Pros**: Meaningful reward boost. Exit option via OVL with penalty. Moderate commitment.

**Cons**: Lock period limits liquidity. Early exit penalties.

**Best for**: Believers with medium-term conviction.

### Aggressive: Permanent Lock

Buy Patron Cards. Lock LP permanently. Earn 10x multiplier.

**Pros**: Maximum rewards. Benefit from others' exit penalties. True diamond hands status.

**Cons**: Zero liquidity. Permanent commitment.

**Best for**: Ultra-long-term believers in project mission.

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I evaluate projects?**
A: Check team background, read whitepaper, assess community size, verify code is open source, look for audit reports.

**Q: What's a good allocation per project?**
A: Most investors allocate 1-5% of portfolio per project. Diversify across 10-20 projects to reduce risk.

**Q: Can I lose all my money?**
A: Yes. If token price goes to zero, your investment value goes to zero. You still can't get rugged, but market risk remains.

**Q: How do I know a project won't abandon development?**
A: You don't. That's why research and diversification matter. Look for teams with track records and clear roadmaps.

**Q: Are returns guaranteed?**
A: No. Returns depend on project execution, market conditions, and trading volume. Past performance doesn't indicate future results.
