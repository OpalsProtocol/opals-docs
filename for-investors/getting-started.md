# Getting Started

This guide walks you through your first investment on Opals, from wallet setup to making your first purchase. No technical background needed.

## What You'll Need

**Hardware**: Computer or smartphone with internet access.

**Software**: Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Brave recommended).

**Funds**: ETH for both investment amount and gas fees (typically $50-$500 investment minimum, plus $10-$20 for gas).

**Time**: 15-30 minutes for complete setup and first purchase.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Wallet

A wallet stores your cryptocurrency and connects to Opals. Think of it like a digital bank account you control.

### MetaMask Setup (Recommended for Beginners)

MetaMask is the most popular crypto wallet. It works as a browser extension.

**Installation**:
1. Go to metamask.io
2. Click "Download"
3. Select your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Brave)
4. Click "Add to Browser"
5. Click "Get Started"

**Creating Your Wallet**:
1. Click "Create a Wallet"
2. Agree to terms
3. Create a strong password (you'll use this to unlock MetaMask)
4. Write down your 12-word recovery phrase
5. Store it somewhere extremely safe (never digital, never photos)
6. Confirm your recovery phrase by selecting words in order

**CRITICAL: Your recovery phrase is everything.** If you lose it and forget your password, your funds are gone forever. If someone steals it, they can steal all your funds. Never share it with anyone. Ever.

### Alternative Wallets

**Coinbase Wallet**: Good for Coinbase users. Similar setup process.

**Ledger or Trezor**: Hardware wallets. Maximum security. Required extra device ($50-$200). Recommended for investments over $10,000.

**Rainbow Wallet**: Mobile-first. Great for phone users.

For this guide, we'll use MetaMask since it's most common.

## Step 2: Fund Your Wallet

You need ETH to invest and pay gas fees. ETH is the currency of the Ethereum network.

### Buying ETH

**From exchanges** (easiest for beginners):
- Coinbase: Buy with credit card or bank transfer
- Binance: Buy with credit card or bank transfer
- Kraken: Buy with bank transfer
- Gemini: Buy with bank transfer

**From friends** (if you know someone with crypto):
- They can send you ETH directly to your wallet address

**From ATMs** (if available in your area):
- Find a Bitcoin ATM that also sells ETH
- Use cash to buy ETH

### How Much ETH Do You Need?

**Minimum investment**: $50-$500 (varies by project)
**Gas fees**: $10-$20 (for transactions)
**Total recommended**: $100-$1,000 for your first investment

**Example**: If you want to invest $500, buy $520 worth of ETH to cover gas fees.

### Sending ETH to Your Wallet

1. Copy your wallet address from MetaMask
2. Go to your exchange
3. Find "Send" or "Withdraw" ETH
4. Paste your wallet address
5. Enter the amount
6. Confirm the transaction
7. Wait for confirmation (5-30 minutes)

**Double-check the address**: If you send to the wrong address, your ETH is gone forever.
