# Getting Started: Your First Opals Investment

This guide walks you through your first investment on Opals, from wallet setup to making your first purchase. No technical background needed.

## What You'll Need

**Hardware**: Computer or smartphone with internet access.

**Software**: Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Brave recommended).

**Funds**: ETH for both investment amount and gas fees (typically $50-$500 investment minimum, plus $10-$20 for gas).

**Time**: 15-30 minutes for complete setup and first purchase.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Wallet

A wallet stores your cryptocurrency and connects to Opals. Think of it like a digital bank account you control.

### MetaMask Setup (Recommended for Beginners)

MetaMask is the most popular crypto wallet. It works as a browser extension.

**Installation**:
1. Go to metamask.io
2. Click "Download"
3. Select your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Brave)
4. Click "Add to Browser"
5. Click "Get Started"

**Creating Your Wallet**:
1. Click "Create a Wallet"
2. Agree to terms
3. Create a strong password (you'll use this to unlock MetaMask)
4. Write down your 12-word recovery phrase
5. Store it somewhere extremely safe (never digital, never photos)
6. Confirm your recovery phrase by selecting words in order

**CRITICAL: Your recovery phrase is everything.** If you lose it and forget your password, your funds are gone forever. If someone steals it, they can steal all your funds. Never share it with anyone. Ever.

### Alternative Wallets

**Coinbase Wallet**: Good for Coinbase users. Similar setup process.

**Ledger or Trezor**: Hardware wallets. Maximum security. Required extra device ($50-$200). Recommended for investments over $10,000.

**Rainbow Wallet**: Mobile-first. Great for phone users.

For this guide, we'll use MetaMask since it's most common.

## Step 2: Fund Your Wallet

You need ETH in your wallet to invest. ETH pays for both your investment and gas fees.

### Buying ETH

**Option 1: Buy directly in MetaMask**
1. Open MetaMask
2. Click "Buy"
3. Select provider (Wyre, Transak, or MoonPay)
4. Follow their identity verification process
5. Buy ETH with credit card or bank transfer

**Fees**: 2-5% typically.

**Time**: 10 minutes to 2 hours depending on verification.

**Option 2: Buy on an exchange**
1. Create account on Coinbase, Kraken, or Gemini
2. Complete identity verification
3. Deposit funds via bank transfer
4. Buy ETH
5. Withdraw ETH to your MetaMask address

**Fees**: 0.5-2% typically. Lower than direct purchase.

**Time**: 1-7 days for verification and bank transfers.

**Option 3: Use existing crypto**
If you already have crypto elsewhere, just send ETH to your MetaMask address.

### How Much ETH to Buy

Calculate: Investment amount + Gas fees + Small buffer

**Example**:
- Want to invest: $500
- Gas fees: ~$15
- Buffer: $35
- Total: $550 worth of ETH

The buffer covers potential gas price increases and future transactions.

### Finding Your Wallet Address

Your wallet address is where others send you crypto. It looks like this: 0x1234...5678

**To copy your address**:
1. Open MetaMask
2. Click on account name at top
3. Address copies automatically
4. Or click the copy icon

Use this address when buying ETH on exchanges.

## Step 3: Connect to Opals

**Note**: Opals platform URL will be provided at launch. Bookmark the official URL. Beware of phishing sites.

**Connection process**:
1. Go to opals.app (example URL)
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Select MetaMask
4. MetaMask pops up asking permission
5. Click "Connect"
6. Select which account to connect

You're now connected. Opals can see your wallet balance but cannot move funds without your explicit approval for each transaction.

## Step 4: Browse Projects

The Opals platform shows all active launches.

**What to look for**:
- Project name and description
- Funding goal and current raised
- Time remaining
- Current batch and price
- Team information
- Links to whitepaper/docs

**Filter options**:
- By category (DeFi, Gaming, NFT, etc.)
- By funding stage (active, upcoming, completed)
- By amount raised
- By time remaining

**Sort options**:
- Newest first
- Most funded
- Ending soon
- Highest volume

Take your time. Browse multiple projects.

## Step 5: Research a Project

Before investing, research thoroughly. Here's your checklist:

### Team Assessment

**Check**:
- Team members listed with real names and photos?
- LinkedIn profiles verifiable?
- Prior projects or work history?
- Active on Twitter or Discord?
- Anonymous teams are higher risk

**Red flags**:
- Fully anonymous team with no track record
- Stock photos instead of real photos
- No prior projects or experience
- Promises that sound too good to be true

### Whitepaper Review

**Read for**:
- Clear problem statement
- Realistic solution
- Defined roadmap with milestones
- Tokenomics that make sense
- Technical approach described

**Red flags**:
- Vague or copied content
- Unrealistic claims
- No clear roadmap
- Poorly written or full of jargon
- Tokenomics favor team over community

### Community Check

**Look at**:
- Discord or Telegram member count
- Activity level (messages per day)
- Quality of discussions
- How team responds to questions
- Presence of obvious bots or paid shills

**Red flags**:
- Tiny or inactive community
- All positive comments, no critical discussion
- Team ignores tough questions
- Spam and bot accounts dominate
- Pressure to invest quickly

### Code Verification

**If you're technical, check**:
- GitHub repository public and active
- Smart contracts on Etherscan
- Recent commits
- Code quality
- Audit reports if available

**If you're not technical**:
- Ask developer friends to review
- Look for audit badges
- Check if code is open source
- Community has reviewed it

### Tokenomics Analysis

**Evaluate**:
- Total supply reasonable?
- Token distribution fair (40% LP, 30% rewards, 30% team is typical)?
- Team tokens locked or vested?
- Use cases for token clear?
- Incentive structure sustainable?

**Red flags**:
- Team gets more than 50% of supply
- No team vesting
- Unclear or missing use case
- Unsustainable reward rates
- Complex or confusing structure

## Step 6: Make Your First Purchase

You've researched. You've decided. Now execute.

### Understanding the Purchase

**You're buying**: Patron Cards (NFTs).

**You receive**: LP token allocation represented by the NFT.

**Timing**: LP tokens only accessible after launch completes.

**Risk**: If project doesn't reach minimum, you can reclaim ETH.

### Choosing Your Batch

Stepped pricing means each batch costs more.

**Example**:
- Batch 1 (cards 1-10): 0.5 ETH each
- Batch 2 (cards 11-20): 0.55 ETH each
- Batch 3 (cards 21-30): 0.605 ETH each

**Strategy**: Earlier batches = better price. But also = higher risk (project might not complete).

**Recommendation for beginners**: Wait until project is 30-50% funded. Risk lower, price still reasonable.

### Purchase Process

1. Click on project
2. Click "Buy Patron Cards"
3. Enter quantity (1-10 typically)
4. Review total cost (price × quantity + gas)
5. Click "Purchase"
6. MetaMask pops up
7. Review transaction details
8. Click "Confirm"
9. Wait for confirmation (usually 30-60 seconds)
10. Success message appears

Your Patron Card now appears in your wallet.

### Transaction Confirmation

**In MetaMask**:
- Click account icon
- Click "Activity"
- See transaction with checkmark (confirmed) or pending

**On Etherscan**:
- Copy transaction hash
- Go to etherscan.io
- Paste hash in search
- View full details

Transaction confirmed = you own your Patron Card.

## Step 7: After Purchase

### View Your Position

**In Opals dashboard**:
- Click "My Investments"
- See all your positions
- Track project progress
- View estimated LP allocation

**In MetaMask**:
- Click "NFTs"
- See your Patron Cards
- Click to view details

### Monitor Project Progress

**Check regularly**:
- Total raised vs goal
- Time remaining
- Community updates
- Team announcements

**Be patient**: Funding periods typically run 1-2 weeks. Check every few days, not every hour.

### What If Project Fails to Launch?

If project doesn't reach minimum threshold:

1. Go to project page
2. Click "Reclaim ETH"
3. Confirm transaction
4. Receive your original investment back (minus original gas fees)

Your Patron Card becomes worthless, but you get your ETH back.

### What If Project Succeeds?

When threshold reached:

1. Liquidity automatically deploys to Uniswap
2. Your Patron Card represents your LP token allocation
3. You start earning LP fees immediately
4. Decide whether to stake for multiplied rewards

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Not Saving Recovery Phrase Securely

**Why it's bad**: Lose it = lose all your funds forever.

**Fix**: Write it on paper. Store in safe or safety deposit box. Never take photos. Never save digitally.

### Mistake 2: Falling for Phishing Sites

**Why it's bad**: Fake sites steal your funds.

**Fix**: Bookmark official Opals URL. Never click links in unsolicited messages. Check URL carefully every time.

### Mistake 3: Investing More Than You Can Afford to Lose

**Why it's bad**: Crypto is extremely volatile. Projects fail.

**Fix**: Only invest money you're comfortable losing completely. Treat it like entertainment budget, not savings.

### Mistake 4: No Research

**Why it's bad**: Scam projects exist. Bad teams exist.

**Fix**: Spend at least 1 hour researching before investing. Check team, read whitepaper, review community.

### Mistake 5: FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)

**Why it's bad**: Rushing leads to bad decisions.

**Fix**: There will always be more opportunities. Missing one project is fine. Losing money to a rushed decision is not.

### Mistake 6: Ignoring Gas Fees

**Why it's bad**: Gas can be $5 or $50 depending on network congestion.

**Fix**: Check gas fees before confirming. Use tools like etherscan.io/gastracker. Consider waiting for lower gas if not urgent.

### Mistake 7: Not Diversifying

**Why it's bad**: One project failure wipes you out.

**Fix**: Split investment across 5-10 projects minimum. No more than 20% in any single project.

### Mistake 8: Sharing Sensitive Info

**Why it's bad**: Scammers target crypto users.

**Fix**: Never share recovery phrase, private keys, or passwords. Real support never asks for these. If asked, it's a scam.

## Security Best Practices

### Hardware Wallet for Large Amounts

If investing over $10,000 total:

**Buy**: Ledger Nano X or Trezor Model T

**Why**: Private keys never touch internet. Much harder to hack.

**How**: Connect via USB or Bluetooth. Approve transactions on device.

### Use Strong Passwords

**Requirements**:
- At least 12 characters
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Unique to this wallet (don't reuse)
- Stored in password manager

**Never**: Use birthdays, names, common words, or simple patterns.

### Enable All Security Features

**In MetaMask**:
- Turn on "Phishing Detection"
- Turn on "Privacy Mode"
- Review connected sites regularly
- Revoke access to sites you don't use

### Watch for Red Flags

**Scam indicators**:
- Unsolicited DMs about "support"
- Requests for recovery phrase or private keys
- "Validate wallet" or "sync wallet" requests
- Too-good-to-be-true returns
- Pressure to act immediately

**Real support**: Never DMs first. Never asks for sensitive info. Patient and professional.
