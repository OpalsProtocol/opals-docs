# Getting Started: Buy Your First Patron Card

Patron Cards are NFTs that give you permanent ownership in a project's liquidity pool. Buy during launch, lock it, earn trading fees forever.

## What You're Buying

Each Patron Card = 1% (or whatever % you own) of the liquidity pool permanently locked on Uniswap.

**You get 3 income streams**:
1. **LP fees**: Opals charges 1% per trade (vs 0.3% standard). You earn your share based on PatronPower.
2. **Reward tokens**: Projects distribute tokens to early supporters based on lock duration.
3. **Price appreciation**: If token price rises, your LP value increases too.

**Example**: Buy 1 card for 1 ETH during launch of $100 total raise
- You own 1% of liquidity pool
- Pool gets $70 in liquidity (after fees)
- Your share: ~$0.7 ETH equivalent in LP tokens
- Daily trading volume $1M = $10k in fees = you earn ~$100/day (1% share)

## Lock Durations & Multipliers

You choose when you lock your card at purchase:

| Lock Duration | Multiplier | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| 7 days | 0.024x | Test it out |
| 90 days | 0.2x | Low commitment |
| 1 year | 1.25x | Moderate belief |
| Permanent | 10x | Diamond hands |

Permanent lock earns **416x more** than 7-day lock (same capital).

## Common Issues

**Project fails to launch?** You get refunded if minimum not reached.

**Not sure how much to invest?** Start small ($100-500) and learn before bigger amounts.

**Crypto price crashes?** That's normal. Only invest what you can afford to lose completely.

## Safety Tips

### Wallet Security

**Never share your recovery phrase**: Anyone with it can steal your funds.

**Use hardware wallets for large amounts**: Ledger or Trezor for investments over $10,000.

**Keep your wallet updated**: Regular updates include security improvements.

**Be careful with permissions**: Only connect to trusted sites.

### Investment Security

**Research before investing**: Don't invest in projects you don't understand.

**Start small**: Learn with small amounts before investing more.

**Diversify**: Don't put all your money in one project.

**Be patient**: Good investments take time to develop.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Transaction pending**: Wait for confirmation. Don't try to cancel.

**Insufficient funds**: Check your ETH balance and gas fees.

**Transaction failed**: Try again with higher gas or check your balance.
