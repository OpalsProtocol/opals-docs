# Strategy & Risk

How to earn maximum returns while protecting yourself from what can go wrong.

## Your Three Lock Strategies

### Strategy 1: Test & Learn (Short Locks)

Lock for 7-90 days on projects you're exploring.

**Use case**: New projects, uncertain teams, learning the mechanics

**Pros**: Low commitment, quick exit, test before bigger bets
**Cons**: Minimal rewards (0.024x-0.2x multiplier)

**Example**: Allocate 10% of portfolio to new projects with 30-day locks

### Strategy 2: Graduated Commitment (Ladder Locks)

Spread your capital across multiple lock durations on ONE project:
- 4 ETH permanent (40 PatronPower)
- 6 ETH for 2 years (15 PatronPower)
- 6 ETH for 1 year (7.5 PatronPower)
- 4 ETH for 90 days (1.24 PatronPower)

**Result**: High rewards + progressively unlocking capital

### Strategy 3: Diamond Hands (Permanent Locks)

Lock forever on projects you absolutely believe in.

**Pros**: 10x multiplier, maximum rewards, best alignment
**Cons**: Capital locked permanently, high conviction required

**Key rule**: Only permanent-lock projects you'd be happy holding for 5+ years

## Time Beats Capital (The Math)

**PatronPower = LP Amount × Time Multiplier**

10 ETH locked 7 days = 0.24 PatronPower
1 ETH locked permanent = 10 PatronPower

Same person who can commit long-term with LESS capital beats whale with short commitment.

## Portfolio Structure (Example: $100k)

**Core (60%, permanent locks)**
- $30k in Project A (team you trust, strong fundamentals)
- $30k in Project B (different sector, diversification)
- Multiplier: 10x each, highly stable

**Growth (30%, 1-2 year locks)**
- $30k spread across 3 projects with 1-2 year locks
- Higher risk, higher potential upside
- Multiplier: 3.75-5x

**Exploratory (10%, short locks)**
- $10k testing 5 new projects with 30-90 day locks
- Learn before committing bigger amounts
- Multiplier: 0.2x-1.25x

## Managing Risk

### Risks Opals Eliminated ✅
- Rug pulls (liquidity locked permanently, no withdrawal function exists)
- Admin theft (no admin keys)
- Bot manipulation (stepped pricing)
- Hidden fees (everything hardcoded)

### Risks You Still Face ⚠️

**Market Risk**: Token price drops 50%
- **Mitigation**: Only invest what you'll hold 2-3 years. Dollar-cost average entries.
- **Don't do**: Panic sell on dips. If you can't handle 30% downswings, you've over-allocated.

**Project Risk**: Team leaves, roadmap slips, product fails
- **Mitigation**: Research before locking. Check team track records. Monitor community engagement monthly.
- **Watch for**: Key people leaving (red flag), product delays stacking up, community declining
- **Response**: When your lock expires, reassess. Exit if fundamentals broke.

**Execution Risk**: Opals has a smart contract bug
- **Mitigation**: Start with $500-1k, not $100k. Code has 375 tests + audits (Certik, Trail of Bits, Quantstamp).
- **Note**: All code can have bugs. Diversify across contracts if worried.

**Regulatory Risk**: Crypto rules change your jurisdiction
- **Mitigation**: Understand local tax laws. Crypto regulations vary by country.
- **Not Opals' problem**: This affects all crypto, not unique to Opals

## When to Exit (Reduce or Abandon)

**Red flags to watch**:
- Key team member leaves without explanation
- Product misses multiple roadmap deadlines
- Community engagement drops >50%
- Volume declining for 3+ months
- You've lost confidence in vision

**What to do**:
- When your lock expires, reassess fundamentals
- Exit gradually (don't panic-sell all at once)
- Redeploy to projects with better signals

## When to Extend Your Lock

**Green flags to extend to permanent**:
- Team executing ahead of schedule
- Community growing and engaged
- Trading volume increasing
- Project gaining real adoption
- You still believe in 5-year vision

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Chasing yield**: Highest APY projects are high-yield because HIGH-RISK. Avoid.

❌ **Over-diversification**: 20 projects = impossible to monitor. Better: 3-5 you know deeply.

❌ **No rebalancing**: Buy-and-forget can work. But review quarterly if fundamentals changed.

❌ **Panic selling**: Market dips 30%, you exit, it recovers 2x. Only invest what you hold through volatility.

❌ **Locking too long too early**: Love a project on day 1, lock for 2 years. 3 months in, it changes. Better: Start with 30-90 days, extend after monitoring.

## Simple Rules

1. **Research before committing**. Bad teams aren't rescued by Opals' security.

2. **Start short, extend long**. 30-day lock first. Permanent lock after 3-6 months of validation.

3. **Diversify (3-5 projects max)**. Spreading $100k across 20 projects is chaos.

4. **Monitor key metrics monthly**:
   - Trading volume (up or down?)
   - Team activity (still building?)
   - Community sentiment (engaged or dismissive?)

5. **Dollar-cost average**. Don't deploy entire allocation day one. Buy over 2-4 weeks.

6. **Only permanent-lock what you'd hold 5+ years**. Seriously.

## Calculate Your Potential Returns

**Example 1: Passive holder**
- $10k Patron Card (1 ETH equivalent LP)
- Daily volume: $10M
- Fees: 1% = $100k daily
- Your share (1% of PatronPower, permanent): ~$50/day = $18,250/year

**Example 2: Active staker**
- $10k into Project A (permanent lock = 10 PatronPower)
- $10k into Project B (1-year lock = 1.25 PatronPower)
- Total: 11.25 PatronPower
- Assumes average $5M volume per project
- Estimated returns: ~$15k/year across both

(Real returns depend on project traffic, competition for PatronPower, and team execution)

## Next Steps

1. Research 3-5 projects you believe in
2. Start with 30-90 day locks to test
3. Once proven, extend or go permanent
4. Monitor monthly, rebalance quarterly
5. Compound rewards by reinvesting

**Most important rule**: You can't beat a bad team or bad product with good strategy. The best returns come from finding genuinely good projects early, committing long-term, and letting compound rewards work their magic.
