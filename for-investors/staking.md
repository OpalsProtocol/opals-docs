# Staking: Time Beats Capital

Most staking systems are ponzi mathematics. Stake tokens, earn 200% APR. Where does that yield come from? New tokens printed from nothing. Your gains dilute everyone else's holdings. Real return after inflation: approximately zero.

Opals staking works differently. You stake LP tokens, not regular tokens. Your rewards come from trading fees, not inflation. And here's the radical part: a $1,000 position locked permanently earns more than $100,000 locked for a week.

## The PatronPower Equation

Time commitment determines earning power through PatronPower multipliers.

Lock for 7 days: 0.024x multiplier. Lock for 30 days: 0.2x. Lock for 90 days: 1x. Lock for a year: 3.75x. Lock for four years: 7.5x. Lock permanently: 10x.

The math is brutal for mercenary capital. A whale staking $1 million for seven days earns the same as someone staking $2,400 permanently. The system mathematically enforces long-term alignment by making short-term plays economically irrational.

## Three Ways to Stake

**Patron Cards**: Buy during the presale, get permanent LP allocation automatically. No choice, no flexibility, maximum rewards. Your card represents staked LP earning 10x PatronPower forever. Sell the card, transfer the stake. The simplest path to maximum returns.

**Vault Cards**: Stake LP tokens after launch with flexible duration. Choose your commitment from 7 days to permanent. Create multiple positions with different lock periods. Exit early with penalties if needed. The flexible path for active managers.

**WorkLock**: Deposit USDC, earn Aave interest, automatically convert to staked LP. Your principal stays liquid and withdrawable anytime. Only the interest converts and stakes. Zero principal risk, pure upside from yield conversion. The safe path for risk-averse capital.

## Real Yield, Not Token Printing

Every trade on OpalSwap generates 1% fees. These fees flow to PatronPower holders proportionally. Your share depends on your PatronPower relative to the total.

If you hold 1% of total PatronPower, you earn 1% of all trading fees. Forever. No dilution, no inflation, no games. Just pure revenue sharing from actual economic activity.

When volume is high, rewards are high. When volume drops, rewards drop. This honesty prevents the death spirals that destroy inflationary protocols. You know exactly what you're earning and why.

## Why LP Tokens Matter

Staking regular tokens creates sell pressure. Stakers dump rewards to realize gains. Price drops. APR increases to compensate. More tokens printed. More selling. Death spiral.

Staking LP tokens creates sustainable economics. LP represents actual liquidity provision. Trading fees reward liquidity providers. The more committed your liquidity (longer lock), the more fees you earn. No inflation required.

This isn't staking theater. It's genuine revenue sharing from protocol activity. The kind of sustainable model that builds wealth over decades, not pump-and-dumps over weeks.
