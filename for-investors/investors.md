# Overview

Traditional crypto investments offer two broken paths: buy liquid tokens and watch whales dump on you, or join VC rounds with three-year lockups and accredited investor requirements. Both extract maximum risk from investors while providing minimum protection.

Opals offers TAFTs: Transferable Agreements for Future Tokens. Think of them as on-chain SAFTs without the lawyers, corporate structures, or geographic restrictions.

## Transferable Aggrements for Future Tokens (TAFTs)

**The problem**: Early-stage crypto investment requires either accepting immediate token volatility (and likely dumps) or surrendering liquidity entirely through traditional SAFT agreements that cost thousands in legal fees.

**The solution**: Patron Cards are NFTs representing future token claims plus permanent LP allocation. They're immediately tradeable on secondary markets, providing liquidity without requiring token launch. If you need to exit before launch, claim 80% of your investment back through the refund mechanism or sell them OTC like any NFT. If the project succeeds, list your card for multiples on the secondary market.

## Multiple Participation Paths

**Direct Purchase**: Buy Patron Cards during market phases. Early rounds get better prices through Keys mechanism. Your card represents both future tokens (vesting over 4 years) and permanent LP allocation earning trading fees forever.

**Secondary Market**: Missed the initial sale? Buy cards on OpenSea. Rights transfer automatically with NFT ownership. No migration, no paperwork, no smart contract interaction required.

**WorkLock (Risk-Free)**: Deposit USDC into WorkLock contracts. Your principal stays liquid and withdrawable anytime. Only the Aave interest converts to LP tokens earning PatronPower rewards. Zero principal risk, pure upside from interest conversion.

## Why This Beats Traditional Investments

No accredited investor gatekeeping. No minimum investment requirements. No geographic restrictions. No three-year lockups with zero liquidity. Just buy a card, hold for rewards, or sell when you want. The smart contracts enforce economic incentives that traditional founders can only promise.
