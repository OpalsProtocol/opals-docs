# Staking Rewards Guide

Lock your LP tokens or project tokens to earn multiplied rewards. Your commitment level determines your multiplier. This guide explains exactly how the system works and how much you can earn.

## Two Staking Options: PatronClaim vs VaultClaim

Opals offers two distinct staking mechanisms with different characteristics.

### PatronClaim: Permanent Lock, Maximum Rewards

**What it is**: When you buy Patron Cards during launch, you automatically participate in PatronClaim. Your LP allocation is locked permanently.

**Multiplier**: 10x (the highest possible)

**Lock period**: Permanent (forever)

**Liquidity**: None. Cannot withdraw LP tokens. Can only sell the Patron Card NFT itself on secondary markets.

**Best for**: True believers committed to the project long-term.

### VaultClaim: Flexible Locks, Variable Rewards

**What it is**: After launch, you can stake LP tokens or project tokens with custom lock periods from 7 days to permanent.

**Multiplier**: 0.024x to 10x depending on lock duration

**Lock period**: You choose (7 days minimum to permanent)

**Liquidity**: Exit early via Open Vested Liquidity (OVL) with penalties, or wait for lock expiration

**Best for**: Investors wanting flexibility and control over commitment level.

## Understanding PatronPower

PatronPower determines your share of reward distributions. Higher PatronPower = larger reward share.

### The Formula

**PatronPower = LP Amount × Time Multiplier**

**For PatronClaim**:
PatronPower = LP Amount × 10

**For VaultClaim**:
PatronPower = LP Amount × (Lock Duration / 4 years) × 5 (capped at 5x for time locks)

Or PatronPower = LP Amount × 10 for permanent locks

### Why This Matters

**Reward distribution**: Your PatronPower determines what percentage of total rewards you receive.

**Compound effect**: Higher PatronPower means more rewards, which can be reinvested for even higher PatronPower.

**Competitive advantage**: Early stakers with long locks get the highest multipliers.

## Reward Sources

### Trading Fees

**Source**: 1% of all trades on the project's Uniswap pool

**Distribution**: Flows to Distributor contract, then to stakers based on PatronPower

**Frequency**: Continuous as trades happen

**Example**: $1M daily volume = $10,000 daily fees. If you have 5% PatronPower, you earn $500 daily.

### Protocol Fees

**Source**: 2% platform fee from project sales

**Distribution**: Part flows to PatronClaim holders as additional rewards

**Frequency**: As projects accumulate fees

**Example**: Project generates $50,000 in protocol fees monthly. With 2% PatronPower, you earn $1,000 monthly.

### Token Appreciation

**Source**: LP token value increases as trading volume and fees accumulate

**Distribution**: Your LP tokens become more valuable over time

**Frequency**: Continuous as the pool grows

**Example**: Your $1,000 LP position grows to $1,500 as the pool accumulates value.

## Staking Strategies

### Strategy 1: Maximum Commitment (PatronClaim)

**What to do**: Buy Patron Cards during launch and hold forever

**Multiplier**: 10x (highest possible)

**Pros**: Maximum rewards, no management needed, permanent protection

**Cons**: No flexibility, cannot exit early

**Best for**: Projects you believe in long-term

### Strategy 2: Gradual Commitment (VaultClaim)

**What to do**: Start with short locks, gradually increase as you gain confidence

**Multiplier**: 0.024x to 10x depending on lock duration

**Pros**: Flexibility, can adjust commitment level, can exit early

**Cons**: Lower multipliers, requires active management

**Best for**: Projects you're learning about

### Strategy 3: Diversified Approach

**What to do**: Mix PatronClaim and VaultClaim across different projects

**Multiplier**: Varies by project and strategy

**Pros**: Diversified risk, optimized returns, flexibility

**Cons**: More complex, requires more management

**Best for**: Experienced investors with multiple projects

## Lock Duration Guide

### Short Locks (7-30 days)

**Multiplier**: 0.024x to 0.2x

**Best for**: Testing new projects, short-term opportunities

**Risk**: Low commitment, low rewards

**Example**: 7-day lock = 0.024x multiplier, 30-day lock = 0.2x multiplier

### Medium Locks (1-6 months)

**Multiplier**: 0.2x to 2.5x

**Best for**: Projects you're confident in but want flexibility

**Risk**: Medium commitment, medium rewards

**Example**: 3-month lock = 1.25x multiplier, 6-month lock = 2.5x multiplier

### Long Locks (6 months - 2 years)

**Multiplier**: 2.5x to 5x

**Best for**: Projects you strongly believe in

**Risk**: High commitment, high rewards

**Example**: 1-year lock = 3.75x multiplier, 2-year lock = 5x multiplier

### Permanent Locks

**Multiplier**: 10x (same as PatronClaim)

**Best for**: Projects you're absolutely certain about

**Risk**: Maximum commitment, maximum rewards

**Example**: Permanent lock = 10x multiplier, same as PatronClaim

## Maximizing Your Returns

### Choose the Right Projects

**Research thoroughly**: Understand what you're staking in

**Check the team**: Look for experienced, credible founders

**Evaluate the product**: Make sure it solves real problems

**Assess the community**: Strong communities drive success

### Optimize Your Lock Duration

**Start short**: Begin with shorter locks to test projects

**Increase gradually**: Extend locks as you gain confidence

**Consider permanent**: For projects you're absolutely certain about

**Diversify**: Mix different lock durations across projects

### Reinvest Your Rewards

**Compound returns**: Reinvest rewards to increase your stake

**Higher PatronPower**: More stake means more rewards

**Exponential growth**: Compound returns can be powerful

**Long-term thinking**: Think in years, not days

## Common Mistakes

### Locking Too Long Too Early

**Mistake**: Locking for 2 years on a project you just discovered

**Why it's bad**: You might want to exit if the project changes

**Better approach**: Start with shorter locks, extend as you learn

### Not Reinvesting Rewards

**Mistake**: Claiming rewards but not reinvesting them

**Why it's bad**: Missing out on compound returns

**Better approach**: Reinvest rewards to increase your stake

### Ignoring Project Quality

**Mistake**: Staking in projects without researching them

**Why it's bad**: You might lose your entire investment

**Better approach**: Research thoroughly before staking

### Panic Selling

**Mistake**: Selling during temporary dips

**Why it's bad**: Missing out on long-term gains

**Better approach**: Stay calm and focus on fundamentals

## Risk Management

### Understand the Risks

**Project risk**: The project might fail or change direction

**Technical risk**: Smart contract bugs could cause losses

**Market risk**: Token prices could go down

**Lock risk**: You might want to exit but can't

### Mitigate the Risks

**Diversify**: Don't put all your money in one project

**Research**: Understand what you're investing in

**Start small**: Begin with smaller amounts

**Stay informed**: Keep up with project developments
