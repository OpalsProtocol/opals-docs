# Market Types & Costs

Choose your market type and understand exactly what you'll pay.

## Your Three Market Options

### Stepped Market (Recommended)

Price increases per batch. Early supporters pay less.

**Example**:
- Batch 1 (cards 1-100): 0.5 ETH each
- Batch 2 (cards 101-200): 0.55 ETH each
- Batch 3 (cards 201-300): 0.60 ETH each

**Advantages**:
- Creates FOMO as price rises (drives sales)
- Rewards early supporters
- Bot resistant (same price within batch)
- Good for most launches

**Best for**: New projects wanting momentum

### Fixed Market

Same price for all cards.

**Example**: All cards 0.75 ETH

**Advantages**:
- Simple to explain
- Fair to all buyers
- Easier psychology

**Best for**: Established communities, preference for fairness

### Members Market

Only existing NFT holders can buy.

**Advantages**:
- Exclusive (creates premium feel)
- Bot proof (requires verification)
- Community curated

**Best for**: Existing DAOs or NFT communities

## Exact Costs

**Platform fee**: 2% of all ETH raised (hardcoded, immutable)
- 50% goes back to you (1% of raise)
- 50% to protocol/referrers

**Gas cost**: ~$15 (deployment only, at 20 gwei)

**Example**: Raise $1M
- You pay: ~$15 gas
- You receive: $980k (after 2% fee)
- Platform fee comes from raises, not your pocket

**Why so cheap?**

Traditional deployment: 7 custom contracts = 35M gas = ~$500
Opals deployment: Contract clones (EIP-1167) = 1.1M gas = ~$15

77x cheaper.

## Comparison: Opals vs Alternatives

| | Opals | VC | Launchpad |
|---|---|---|---|
| Upfront cost | $15 | $0 | $500k |
| Fee on raise | 1% | 0% | 20% |
| Equity dilution | 0% | 30% | 0% |
| Time to launch | 1 week | 6 months | 8 weeks |
| Control retained | 100% | 70% | 100% |

**Example: $2M raise**
- Opals: $20k fee + $15 gas = $20,015
- VC: $100k legal + $600k equity = $700,000
- **Opals saves**: $680,000

## Common Questions

**Do fees change?** No. Hardcoded in contracts.

**Can you refund if launch fails?** If you don't hit minimum raise, supporters get refunded automatically.

**Is the 2% fee per transaction?** No. Once on raise amount. Platform fee comes from supporter ETH, not your wallet.

**What if I run out of money pre-launch?** You only pay ~$15 gas before market goes live. Nothing else upfront.
