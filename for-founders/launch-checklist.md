## Red Flags to Avoid

These are common mistakes that hurt launches:

### Before Launch

- [ ] **NOT launching to zero audience** (build 50+ engaged people first)
- [ ] **NOT overpricing early batches** (start 30-50% below clearing price)
- [ ] **NOT using unclear tokenomics** (transparency builds trust)
- [ ] **NOT skipping legal review** (consult counsel on securities laws)

### During Launch

- [ ] **NOT going radio silent** (daily updates minimum)
- [ ] **NOT ignoring questions** (answer everything)
- [ ] **NOT overselling returns** (don't guarantee price performance)
- [ ] **NOT changing terms** (immutable anyway, but don't try to reframe)

### After Launch

- [ ] **NOT forgetting reward distributions** (consistency matters)
- [ ] **NOT abandoning community** (maintain engagement)
- [ ] **NOT failing to deliver roadmap** (ship what you promised)
- [ ] **NOT focusing only on price** (build product, price follows)

---

## Success Metrics

By end of first month, healthy projects show:

### During Sale

- [ ] **50%+ sold in first 3 days** (good momentum)
- [ ] **Active community engagement** (questions being asked, excitement visible)
- [ ] **Steady purchase velocity** (not all in first hour, not painfully slow)

### Post-Launch

- [ ] **At least one reward distribution** (showing consistency)
- [ ] **Active development visible** (shipping roadmap milestones)
