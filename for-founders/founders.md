# For Founders

You have three broken paths to raise capital: surrender equity to VCs, pay extortion fees to launchpads, or spend months building custom contracts that might have rug-pull vulnerabilities. All three extract value without proportional return.

Opals offers a fourth path that didn't exist before: direct community funding with mathematically enforced fairness.

## The Product-Market Fit

**The problem**: Crypto founders need capital to build. Traditional fundraising mechanisms either demand equity surrender (VCs taking 35%+ plus control), platform extraction (launchpads charging $500K upfront plus 7% tokens), or technical complexity (custom deployments requiring developers, audits, and weeks of work).

**The gap**: No infrastructure exists for permissionless, non-extractive, community-funded token launches that prevent rug pulls through code rather than promises.

**The solution**: Opals provides battle-tested smart contract templates that deploy complete token launch infrastructure in five minutes. Eighty percent of raised capital locks permanently in liquidity pools with no withdrawal function. The remaining twenty percent goes to your treasury immediately. PatronPower ensures long-term believers earn disproportionately compared to mercenary capital.

## Disintermediation Finally Arrives

Launchpads extract because they can. They control access to concentrated capital and charge accordingly. But crypto enables disintermediation. Smart contracts can enforce fairness better than humans can promise it. The infrastructure finally exists to bypass extractive intermediaries entirely.

The comparison is stark: traditional launchpad listing demands $500K plus 7% tokens plus 20% revenue share. Opals charges 4% on raised capital. For a $200K raise, launchpads extract over $100K in fees. Opals takes 4% ($8K). You keep 100% of your tokens. You maintain 100% control. You launch in days, not months.

## What You Get

Complete deployment in one transaction. Permanent liquidity locks that make rug pulls cryptographically impossible. Stepped pricing that prevents bot exploitation. PatronPower distribution that rewards conviction over capital. Fee-based rewards that create sustainable community economics without inflation.

Most importantly: you keep control. No board seats. No quarterly reports. No Series B dilution. Just direct funding from supporters who believe in what you're building, enforced by code that cannot be corrupted.
