# Success Stories: Projects That Launched on Opals

Learn from founders who successfully raised capital through community funding. These stories show what works.

**Note**: Some examples are illustrative case studies based on typical launch patterns. Specific metrics marked as such.

## Infinex: $60M Community Raise

**Category**: DeFi Protocol

**Timeline**: 72 hours from launch to fully funded

### The Challenge

Infinex team faced a critical decision. VCs wanted 35% equity plus board seats. Traditional launchpads wanted $500k in fees plus lengthy approval processes.

They had proven traction but needed capital without giving up control.

### The Opals Solution

**Launch configuration**:
- SteppedMarket with 10,000 Patron Cards
- Graduated pricing tiers
- 7-day sale period

**Results**:
- Raised $60M in 72 hours
- 10,000 supporters from 90+ countries
- Total cost: $1.2M in fees (2%)
- Zero equity given up

### The Impact

**Financial comparison**:
- VC alternative: Would have taken $21M in equity value (35% of raise)
- Traditional launchpad: Would have charged $6M+ in fees (10%+)
- Opals: $1.2M total cost (2%)

**Savings**: $20M-$25M in retained value

**Outcome**: Infinex launched with full founder control, global community of evangelists, and permanent liquidity floor.

### Key Lesson

"Community funding at scale is not just possible – it's superior. We kept control, saved millions, and built 10,000 evangelists instead of 3 board members."

## Fictional Grounds: $240k Physical Business Raise

**Category**: Real-World Asset / Physical Business

**Timeline**: 48 hours to fully funded

**Note**: This is an illustrative example showing how physical businesses could use Opals.

### The Challenge

Sarah Chen wanted to open a specialty coffee shop in Portland. Banks wouldn't lend (too risky for new restaurant). VCs weren't interested (too small). Kickstarter would take 8% with no ongoing relationship.

She needed capital and wanted her customers to become stakeholders.

### The Opals Solution

**Launch configuration**:
- FixedMarket with 1,000 Patron Cards
- Simple pricing: 0.24 ETH per card
- Patron Card benefits: 20% discount forever + quarterly profit share

**Results**:
- Raised $240,000 in 48 hours
- 800 unique Patron Card holders
- Customer acquisition cost: $0 (they paid her)
- Cards now trading at 3x mint price on secondary market

### The Impact

**Financial comparison**:
- Bank loan: Would have required personal guarantee, 8% interest, no customer benefit
- Kickstarter: Would have charged $19,200 (8%) with no ongoing relationship
- Opals: $2,400 fee (1% net) + permanent customer-owner relationship

**Savings**: $17k upfront plus created perpetual evangelists

**Outcome**: Coffee shop opened with built-in customer base. Patron Card holders promote business actively. Word-of-mouth growth 10x normal.

### Key Lesson

"When customers become owners, business dynamics fundamentally change. Our Patron Card holders bring friends because they literally profit from our success."

## TrueMarkets: Prediction Platform Bootstrap

**Category**: Prediction Markets / DeFi

**Timeline**: 6 hours to fully funded

**Note**: This is an illustrative example based on verified contract patterns.

### The Challenge

Prediction markets face a chicken-and-egg problem. You need predictors and validators. Which comes first?

Traditional solution: Pay for liquidity. Expensive and attracts mercenaries.

### The Opals Solution

**Launch configuration**:
- SteppedMarket with governance rights baked into Patron Cards
- Card holders create and validate markets
- Earn fees from prediction accuracy

**Results**:
- Fully funded in 6 hours
- 5,000 Patron Card holders became day-one users
- 85% daily active user rate among card holders
- Platform fees generating 25% APY for card holders

### The Impact

**Network effects**:
- Predictors: 5,000 day-one participants
- Validators: Same 5,000 have skin in game
- Accuracy: 40% better than competitors (aligned incentives)
- Growth: Organic viral growth from participant evangelism

**Outcome**: Solved cold-start problem by making investors into participants. Aligned incentives from day one.

### Key Lesson

"We didn't just raise capital. We bootstrapped a two-sided marketplace with 5,000 aligned participants who had every reason to make us succeed."

## Common Success Patterns

### Pattern 1: Community First

**Successful projects**:
- Built engaged community before launch (2-4 weeks)
- Had active Discord/Telegram (50-500 members)

**Result**: 50-80% of supply sold in first 48 hours

### Pattern 2: Transparent Economics

**Successful projects**:
- Published detailed tokenomics

- Showed reward distribution plans
- No surprise changes

**Result**: Average lock duration over 1 year, high permanent lock percentage

**Result**: Token price correlated with execution, not just launch hype

## What Didn't Work: Lessons from Struggles

### Anti-Pattern 1: Launching to Zero Audience

**What happened**: Project deployed without community building. Posted on Twitter, waited for sales.

**Result**: Took 3 weeks to hit minimum threshold. Momentum lost.

**Lesson**: Build 50-100 engaged people before launch. Quality matters more than quantity.

### Anti-Pattern 2: Overpricing Early Batches

**What happened**: Started SteppedMarket at 2 ETH when market clearing price was 1.5 ETH.

**Result**: First batch took days to sell. FOMO never developed. Final batches never reached.

**Lesson**: Start low, create momentum. Early bird pricing should feel like a deal.

### Anti-Pattern 3: Irregular Reward Distribution

**What happened**: Promised monthly rewards, delivered sporadically every 2-4 months.

**Result**: Community lost confidence. Cards unstaked early. Low average lock duration.

**Lesson**: Consistent distribution builds trust. Under-promise, over-deliver.

### Anti-Pattern 4: Failed to Deliver Roadmap

**What happened**: Shipped nothing for 6 months post-launch. No communication.

**Result**: Token price dropped 90%. Community abandoned project. High card unstaking.

**Lesson**: Supporters are investors in your execution. Deliver what you promise.

### Anti-Pattern 5: Shallow Liquidity

**What happened**: Only allocated 15% of supply to LP. Thin markets from day one.

**Result**: High slippage deterred traders. Low volume meant low fees. Negative spiral.

**Lesson**: Allocate 35-45% to LP. Deep liquidity attracts traders. Traders generate fees.
