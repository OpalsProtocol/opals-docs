# For Founders

You're building something meaningful. You have a vision. You need capital.

Traditional funding is broken. VCs demand 35% equity plus board control. Launchpads charge $500K in fees plus 7% of your tokens. Both take weeks to months.

There's a better way.

## Launch in 5 Minutes. Keep 100% Control.

Opals lets you raise funds directly from your future supporters. Deploy your entire token launch infrastructure in 5 minutes. Pay $15 instead of $1,000 in gas fees. Keep complete control of your project.

Your supporters become permanent stakeholders, not mercenary speculators. Liquidity is locked forever, making rug pulls mathematically impossible. True believers earn 10x rewards through PatronPower.

The result? You get the capital you need, your supporters get sustainable rewards, and nobody can game the system.

### 74.7% Lower Gas Costs

Deploy for $15 instead of $60. Template factory pattern creates lightweight contract clones. Every project uses the same battle-tested templates.

### 100% Unruggable Liquidity

Liquidity is locked permanently. No admin keys exist to withdraw funds. The smart contract reverts on withdrawal attempts. Rug pulls are mathematically impossible.

### 10x Rewards for Diamond Hands

PatronPower rewards long-term commitment. Permanent locks earn 10x multiplier. Short-term speculators earn 0.024x. True believers win.

### Bot-Proof Fair Launch

Stepped pricing eliminates bot advantage. Each batch sells at the same price. Early supporters save money without creating FOMO panic.
