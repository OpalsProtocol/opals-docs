# Launch Process

From first decision to trading. Most projects complete in 10 days.

## What Happens (The 5 Phases)

**Phase 1: Pre-Launch** (2-3 days)
- Decide: raise target, token allocation, market type, ETH split
- Build community awareness
- Not on Opals yet - this is your prep work

**Phase 2: Configure** (30 minutes)
- Fill dashboard form with your decisions
- Settings lock forever after this
- No reversals

**Phase 3: Deploy** (5 minutes)
- Click deploy, pay ~$15 gas
- Contracts wire automatically
- Your market goes live

**Phase 4: Card Sale** (1 week typical)
- Community buys Patron Cards at your prices
- You monitor and engage
- Stop whenever you want

**Phase 5: Liquidity Launch** (automatic)
- Sale ends → ETH + tokens combine → Uniswap pair created → LP locks forever
- One transaction, zero manual steps
- Trading begins immediately

## Your Three Critical Decisions

### 1. How Much to Raise?

This determines everything: card supply, pricing, liquidity depth.

Examples:
- Small: $50k-$250k
- Medium: $250k-$2M
- Large: $2M+

Pick a number and commit.

### 2. How to Price Cards?

**Stepped** (recommended): Price increases per batch
- First 100 cards: 0.5 ETH
- Next 100 cards: 0.55 ETH
- Creates sustained momentum
- Bot resistant

**Fixed**: Same price for all cards
- Simpler to explain
- Better for established communities
- Less bot resistance

### 3. How to Split the ETH?

Example: Raise 1,000 ETH
- 30% to your team wallet (you get ~$600k immediately)
- 70% to liquidity (you get deep pool, stable price)

More to team = more cash now, thinner liquidity
More to liquidity = deeper pool, better price stability

## Token Allocation

You control the 1 billion token supply:
- 50% → Liquidity pool (permanent lock)
- 30% → Team/dev (vesting recommended)
- 20% → Airdrop/community/reserves

Can't change after deployment. Choose carefully.

## What You Actually Do

**Before launch**: Build community. That's 90% of the work.

**During sale**: Share link, answer questions, celebrate milestones. That's it.

**After launch**: Your supporters earn rewards automatically. Your liquidity is locked automatically. You build your product.

## What Opals Does (Automatically)

- Deploys all contracts (you fill out a form)
- Collects ETH from card sales
- Creates Uniswap pair when sale ends
- Locks LP tokens permanently (no team can remove them)
- Distributes trading fees based on PatronPower (10x for permanent locks)

## Key Numbers

- **Gas cost**: ~$15 (vs $500+ for custom contracts)
- **Platform fee**: 2% on NFT sales (50% comes back to you)
- **Lock multipliers**: 7-day = 0.024x, permanent = 10x (416x advantage)
- **Timeline**: Deploy to trading = 10 days typical

## What Can Go Wrong

**Sales are slow** → Your community isn't excited. This is a product/market fit problem, not an Opals problem.

**Can't change parameters after deployment** → Intentional. Protects supporters from manipulation.

**Rug pull risk** → Zero. LP tokens locked permanently in contract with no withdrawal function.

## Next Steps

1. Make your three decisions (raise target, market type, ETH split)
2. Build community for 2-3 days
3. Go to dashboard and deploy
4. Run your sale
5. Opals handles everything else
