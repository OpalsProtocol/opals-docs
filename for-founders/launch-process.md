# Launch Process

This guide walks you through launching your token on Opals from pre-launch planning to post-launch growth. Most founders complete the entire process in about 10 days.

## Timeline Overview

**Pre-Launch** (2-3 days): Design tokenomics, build community, prepare marketing

**Configuration** (30 minutes): Set up wallet, choose market type, configure pricing

**Deployment** (5 minutes): Deploy contracts through factory

**Active Sale** (1 week typical): Monitor progress, engage community

**Automatic Launch** (instant): Liquidity provision happens automatically at threshold

**Post-Launch** (ongoing): Track metrics, distribute rewards, grow project

Total time from decision to trading: 10 days average.

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch (2-3 Days)

### Design Your Tokenomics

Before deploying anything, design your token distribution:

**Recommended allocation**:
- 40% to liquidity pool
- 30% to reward distributions
- 30% to team and development

This creates healthy liquidity, rewards supporters, and funds development.

**Set your raise target**: How much ETH do you need?
- Small projects: $50k-$250k
- Medium projects: $250k-$2M
- Large projects: $2M+

Your target determines your Patron Card supply and pricing.

### Choose Your Market Type

Three market types available:

**SteppedMarket**: Batch-based pricing with increases. Best for most launches. Creates FOMO while staying bot-resistant.

**FixedMarket**: Same price for every NFT. Simplest option. Best for established communities.

**MembersMarket**: Requires existing NFT ownership to participate. Best for exclusive club launches.

### Build Your Community

Start building excitement before launch:

**Social media**: Twitter, Discord, Telegram. Share your vision. Show progress. Build anticipation.

**Content marketing**: Blog posts, videos, podcasts. Explain your project. Show your expertise.

**Influencer outreach**: Partner with crypto influencers. Get them excited about your project.

**Community events**: AMAs, live streams, contests. Engage your audience. Build relationships.

### Prepare Your Marketing

Create assets you'll need during launch:

**Project pitch deck**: 10-15 slides explaining your vision, team, and roadmap.

**Video introduction**: 2-3 minute overview of your project and why it matters.

**Social media graphics**: Banners, profile pictures, post templates.

**Press kit**: High-resolution images, team bios, project descriptions.

### Configure Tokenomics

Set your token distribution:

**Total supply**: How many tokens will exist? 1 billion is common.

**Decimals**: Usually 18 for ERC-20 tokens.

**Allocation percentages**: Set how tokens are distributed between different card types.

**Vesting schedules**: How long each card type must wait before claiming tokens.

### Choose Your Market Type

Select the market mechanism that fits your project:

**SteppedMarket**: Set batch sizes and price increments. Create urgency while staying fair.

**FixedMarket**: Set a single price for all cards. Simple and predictable.

**MembersMarket**: Configure vouching requirements. Create exclusive access.

### Set Pricing Strategy

Determine your Patron Card prices:

**Starting price**: What's the minimum price for early supporters?

**Price increments**: How much does the price increase per batch?
