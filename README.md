Opals provides an integrated, transparent launchpad for early-stage crypto projects, focusing on:

* Early-Stage “Patron Cards”: Projects can crowdfund through limited edition digital collectibles that can claim future benefits.
* Simplified Token Engineering: Optional vesting or distribution frameworks, clearly disclosed in advance and committed onchain.
* Token Launches: Built-in contracts that automate liquidity creation when funding and token launch price targets are met.
* Template Factory: Customizable smart contract “recipes” that reduce the need for deep technical support, and build trust.&#x20;
