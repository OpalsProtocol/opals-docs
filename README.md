# Opals: Community-Funded Token Launches

**Deploy a complete token ecosystem in minutes. Community funds your project. Supporters earn forever. No VCs, no fees, no rugs.**

## What It Is

Opals is self-service infrastructure for token launches. Deploy token + NFT market + liquidity + staking in one transaction. Keep 100% control. Pay $15 instead of $500K.

## Why It Matters

**Problem**: VCs take 35% equity + control. Launchpads charge $500K + 7% tokens. Custom contracts take months + risk.

**Solution**: Direct community funding. Your supporters become permanent owners. Liquidity locked forever = mathematically impossible to rug.

## How It Works

1. **Deploy** - Configure parameters, click deploy (~$15 gas)
2. **Sell** - Community buys Patron Cards (NFTs) at stepped prices
3. **Launch** - Sale ends → Uniswap pair created → LP locked forever
4. **Earn** - Supporters claim trading fees based on PatronPower multiplier

## Key Numbers

- **Cost**: $15 deployment (vs $500K launchpad, $100K+ VC legal)
- **Fee**: 2% on NFT sales (50% back to creator)
- **Multiplier**: 10x for permanent locks (vs 1x 7-day stakers)
- **Gas Savings**: 94.7% (EIP-1167 minimal proxies)
