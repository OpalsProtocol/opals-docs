# Opals: Community-Funded Token Launches

**Deploy a complete token ecosystem in minutes. Community funds your project. Supporters earn forever. No VCs, no fees, no rugs.**

## What It Is

Opals is self-service infrastructure for token launches. Deploy token + Presale NFTs + Token Claims + LP Vaults + Fee Distributor + Yield Generator, all in one transaction.

## Why It Matters

**Problem**:  No legitimate project will ever launch on a bonding curve. VCs tokens and take 35% equity + control. Launchpads charge $500K + 10% tokens for "Market Making" your project to zero. Community is last. 

**Solution**: Direct community ownership. Your supporters become owners of Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL). Diamond hand vesting makes rugpulls economically irrational. Rewards distributed to owners of POL.

## How It Works

1. **Deploy** - Create 9 contracts in one transaction (~$15 gas)
2. **Sell** - Patrons buys Presale NFTs (Cards) with locked tokens
3. **Launch** - Token launcher triggers when ETH threshold is reached, LP allocated to presale cards.
4. **Trade** - Token trades, generates 1% fees on OpalSwap (vs 0.3% standard Uniswap)
5. **Earn** - Presale cards claim based on POL, late adopters need to lock LP to earn share of rewards.
6. **Stake** - Whales can farm POL by generating yield and sharing with the community.
