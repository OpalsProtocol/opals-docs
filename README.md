Stop asking VCs for permission. Fund your project through community supporters.

Deploy your complete token launch in minutes, not weeks. No coding required. No board seats given away. No $500K in fees.

## Why Opals Exists

Traditional funding is broken. VCs demand 35% equity plus board control. Launchpads charge $500K in fees plus 7% of your tokens. Both take weeks to months.

Your community wants to support you directly. They believe in your vision. They want to be part of your success from day one.

Opals makes this possible. Deploy your entire project in minutes. Keep 100% control of it.

## Launch complete ecosystems in minutes

No custom coding required. No smart contract expertise needed. No weeks of development time.

Configure your project through simple parameters. Click deploy. Your complete ecosystem goes live.

NFT market, token contract, liquidity pool, staking system. All deployed together. All working immediately.

## Get Rewarded for Conviction

Early believers earn more rewards than speculators. This is mathematically locked in by smart contracts.

Liquidity is permanently locked. Earn maximum rewards. Support projects long-term.

This prevents mercenary capital. It rewards genuine supporters. It creates sustainable projects.

## Founders

Launch your token without giving up equity or control.

You choose pricing. You set parameters. You keep decision-making power.

No VCs demanding board seats. No launchpads taking 7% fees. Just you and your community.
