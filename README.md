<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-01-30 at 12.58.47 PM.png" alt="Opals Platform Interface"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Stop asking VCs for permission. Fund your project through community supporters.

Deploy your complete token launch in minutes, not weeks. No coding required. No board seats given away. No $500K in fees.

## Why Opals Exists

Traditional funding is broken. VCs demand 35% equity plus board control. Launchpads charge $500K in fees plus 7% of your tokens. Both take weeks to months.

Your community wants to support you directly. They believe in your vision. They want to be part of your success from day one.

Opals makes this possible. Deploy your entire project for $15. Launch in 5 minutes. Keep 100% control.

## Three Core Benefits

### 1. Deploy for $15, Not $1,000

Traditional contract deployment costs $1,000+ in gas fees. Complex projects can cost $3,000+.

Opals uses lightweight contract clones. Each deployment costs just $15.

That's 74.7% savings. More budget for building. Less worry about gas costs.

### 2. Launch in 5 Minutes, Not 5 Weeks

No custom coding required. No smart contract expertise needed. No weeks of development time.

Configure your project through simple parameters. Click deploy. Your complete ecosystem goes live.

NFT market, token contract, liquidity pool, staking system. All deployed together. All working immediately.

### 3. Community Gets Rewarded for Commitment

Early believers earn 10x more rewards than speculators. This is mathematically guaranteed by smart contracts.

Lock liquidity permanently. Earn maximum rewards. Support projects long-term.

This prevents mercenary capital. It rewards genuine supporters. It creates sustainable projects.

## Who Uses Opals

### Founders

Launch your token without giving up equity or control.

You choose pricing. You set parameters. You keep decision-making power.

No VCs demanding board seats. No launchpads taking 7% fees. Just you and your community.

### Supporters

Become an early believer in projects you trust.

Your commitment level determines rewards. Permanent locks earn 10x more than short-term stakes.

Liquidity is permanently locked. Projects cannot rug. Your investment is protected by smart contracts.

### Developers

Build on production-ready infrastructure. 375 tests passing. Complete security audits.

All contracts use battle-tested patterns. CEI pattern enforced. Reentrancy protection throughout.

Deploy through template factory. Inherit proven security. Focus on your unique features.

## Trust Indicators

**Production Ready**: All contracts audited and tested.

**375/375 Tests Passing**: Complete test coverage across all components.

**Reentrancy Protection**: NonReentrant modifiers on all state-changing functions.

**CEI Pattern Enforced**: Checks-Effects-Interactions throughout codebase.

**2% Platform Fee**: Transparent, hardcoded fee structure. 50% goes to project creators.

## How It Works

Four simple phases from idea to live project:

**Phase 1: Configuration**

Set your token details. Choose your market type. Define reward parameters. All through simple inputs.

**Phase 2: NFT Sale**

Sell Patron Cards to early supporters. They fund your project. They become permanent stakeholders.

**Phase 3: Token Launch**

Raised funds create liquidity on Uniswap V2. Initial price determined by raise amount. Liquidity locked permanently.

**Phase 4: Rewards**

Trading fees flow to Patron Card holders. Commitment level determines share. Permanent locks earn 10x more.

## Key Features

### PatronPower Rewards

Time-weighted reward system that prevents mercenary capital.

Lock for 7 days: 0.024x multiplier. Lock permanently: 10x multiplier. That's a 416x difference.

Short-term stakers earn almost nothing. Diamond hands earn exponentially more.

### Unruggable Liquidity

LP tokens locked permanently in smart contracts. No withdrawal function exists.

This is cryptographically enforced. Not a promise. Not a timelock. Mathematically impossible to remove.

Projects cannot rug. Supporters can buy with confidence.

[See the proof →](core-concepts/permanent-liquidity.md)

### Template Factory

Deploy complete project ecosystems through pre-audited contract templates.

Every project inherits the same security. Same testing. Same guarantees.

Gas costs reduced by 74.7%. Development time reduced to minutes.

[Explore template factory →](core-concepts/template-factory.md)

### Open Vested Liquidity

Need to exit early? You can. With penalties that reward those who stay.

Exit penalty = (Remaining Time / Total Time) × 50%. At expiry: 0% penalty. At start: 50% penalty.

Penalties redistribute to diamond hands. Flexibility exists. But commitment wins.

## Real Results

**Infinex DeFi**: Raised $60M in 72 hours through community funding. Token performed 15x from launch. $12M liquidity permanently locked.

**TrueMarkets**: Fully funded in 6 hours. 85% of card holders active daily. 25% APY to supporters.

Note: Results vary by project. These are examples from successful launches.

## Network Support

**Base**: Lowest gas costs, optimal for most projects.

**Optimism**: L2 scaling with Ethereum security.

**Monad Testnet**: High-performance testing environment.

**Ethereum Mainnet**: Maximum security and liquidity.

All networks use identical contracts. Same security guarantees everywhere.

## Economics

### Platform Fees

2% fee on NFT sales. Breakdown:
- 50% to project creator (1% of sale)
- 20% to protocol (0.4% of sale)
- 15% to platform referrer (0.3% of sale)
- 15% to order referrer (0.3% of sale)

This fee is hardcoded in smart contracts. Cannot be changed after deployment.

### Trading Rewards

Custom Uniswap V2 fork charges 1% per swap. 100% goes to Distributor for PatronPower-weighted rewards.

LP allocation based on PatronPower. Permanent locks earn 10x base rate.

Rewards accumulate automatically. Claim anytime through smart contracts.
