# Opals: Community-Funded Token Launches

**Deploy a complete token ecosystem in minutes. Community funds your project. Supporters earn forever. No VCs, no fees, no rugs.**

## What It Is

Opals is self-service infrastructure for token launches. Deploy token + Presale NFTs + Token Claims + LP Vaults + Fee Distributor + Yield Generator, all in one transaction.

## Why It Matters

**Problem**: VCs take 35% equity + control. Launchpads charge $500K + 7% tokens. Custom contracts take months + risk.

**Solution**: Direct community funding. Your supporters become permanent owners. Liquidity locked forever = mathematically impossible to rug.

## How It Works

1. **Deploy** - Configure parameters, click deploy (~$15 gas)
2. **Sell** - Community buys Patron Cards (NFTs) at stepped prices
3. **Launch** - Sale ends → OpalSwap pair created → LP locked forever
4. **Earn** - Supporters claim trading fees based on PatronPower multiplier
