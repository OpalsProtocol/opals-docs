## Content Organization Principles

### 1. Three-Tier Clarity
- **Marketing-First (Accessibility)**: Overview section explains why Opals matters
- **Conceptual (Understanding)**: For-Founders/Investors explain how to use it
- **Technical Precision**: Components/Mechanisms/Technical provide implementation details

### 2. Action-First Structure
Each section answers:
1. Should I use this? (Why)
2. How do I use this? (How)
3. What are the details? (Technical specs)

### 3. Problem → Solution Pattern
Every section opens with:
- The problem it solves
- The solution Opals provides
- How it guarantees that solution

### 4. Real Numbers Throughout
No vague claims like "much cheaper" or "significantly faster"
- Actual costs: $15 vs $500K
- Actual multipliers: 10x vs 0.024x
- Actual savings: 74.7% gas reduction

### 5. Navigation and Cross-Linking
- Every page links to related pages
- Decision trees help readers find relevant sections
- "Next Steps" sections provide clear progression

## GitBook Configuration

This documentation is optimized for GitBook with:

- **SUMMARY.md**: Table of contents for navigation
