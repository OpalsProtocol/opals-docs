# Token Launcher

Projects can launch a token with the Token Launcher. The launcher is a smart contract that collect funds, and holds 10% of the project tokens, then when a funding target is met, creates a liquidity pool. The project admin would set the target, and once it reaches its goal, launches a token permissionlessly.&#x20;

&#x20;The launcher funds can come from the sale of patron cards or sent directly from the project treasury. Once token launcher has accumulated enough funds, it matches it with the 10% project tokens, create a liquidity pool on an AMM, and the token is launched and publicly tradable on OpalSwap.\
\
Tokenomics are set by selecting different cards within the project or wider community, and how many  tokens each card gets.\
