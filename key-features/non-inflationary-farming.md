# Non-inflationary Farming

Projects with tokens on OpalSwap are able to set a 1% swap fee that is built into the exchange. Fees from the token swaps will go to the projects rewards distributor. This distributor is responsible for accumulating tokens which the Patron Cards can claim. \
\
Because the cards that claim are NFTs we don't have to do snapshots. Card holders can claim at their own discression, letting others accumulate and claim when they need to. \
\
For non Patron Card holders, there is still an opportunity to claim, by converting ETH into LP tokens and locking them as veLP NFTs called Liquidity Cards.  Our LiquidityZap smart contract does this automatically, locking for as little as 1 week to 4 years, with longer lock periods earning more multiplier. Liquidity Cards can be sold on the secondary market without needing to be unlocked. \
\
This is a novel way to reward both Patron and Liquidity Card holders for the life of the project and it doesn't involve diluting the token supply.  We call it Non-inflationary Farming.
