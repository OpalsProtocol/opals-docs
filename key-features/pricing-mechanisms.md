# Pricing Mechanisms

## Pricing something new is hard.

**Fixed Pricing - DEAD**

Set the price too low, it gets snippered. Set the price too high, its dead. We need some form of price discover which leads us to the following

**Dutch Auctions - Bearish**

Fair launches are not fair. With a dutch auction, money is collected, and at the end, everyone who contributed, get a proportional amount. Everyone paying the same price at the end makes sense for tulips, but not risk based items. Early risk takers are not rewarded for being early. Equal pricing is not equitable.

**Bonding curves - PvP**\
The opposite is true for bonding curves. No one wants to be the greater fool in a graduated bonding curve, buying at 0.345 ETH and hoping someone else will pay slightly more at 0.346 ETH. Or worse, a friend telling you to buy, only for them to dump on you at 0.346 ETH. Any time you have ever seen an address in twitter or telegram with the suffix ..pUMp you know someone bought before posting publicly.&#x20;

## A Better Way to Sell Cards

**The Solution**\
Opals introduces **stepped pricing**, a new way to launch projects. Here's how it works:

*   **Limited Batches**

    Tokens are released in medium sized, fixed batches at increasing prices

    * For Example 500 cards:
      * First 100 Cards @ 1 ETH
      * Next 100 Cards @ 1.5 ETH
      * Currently 13 left @ 2.5 ETH
      * Final 100 Cards @ 3 ETH
* **Safety Features**
  * ü§ñ Front running attacks don't make sense for stepped pricing
  * üíé Early adopters are rewarded with a lower price
  * üîî Ccollaborative, we buy on the same price, and aim to get to the next step.
  * ‚è≥ You can sell back at the same price you bought in, minus 30% burn tax

**How It Helps Projects**

* Creates an incentive for early risk takers for being early
* Provides a transparent way to raise capital at increasing valuations
* Predictable fundraising with clear min/max goals
* PVP is replaced with collaboration to get to the next price step

## **The Bigger Picture**

Opals is more than just a launchpad‚Äîit's a movement to make crypto fairer and more sustainable. By combining stepped pricing with tools like Patron Cards and onchain tokenomics, we're building a future where projects and their communities thrive together.

**New Mechanisms**\
We have three new pricing mechanism at various stages of development. Our team has been in the game since day one has a few cool ideas that will have to wait till Opals is on mainnet. Our framework is already complicated enough for new people, without adding more advanced auction mechanisms, but rest assured, we have a few things in the oven when it comes to pricing.&#x20;
