# Diamond Hand Vesting

After the presale and after the liquidity is launched the tokens are freely tradeable on the secondary market. Each Claim Card has a vesting schedule that determines when the tokens can be claimed. we allow projects to have various different vesting terms as part of the project.

Our first vesting contracts are called Diamond Hands where you set a period of time for your tokens to be claimed, say 10 days, during this period of time a pro rata amount of tokens are able to be claimed per Claim Card however if you would claim early, let's say after five days, you would donate the remaining five days of token allocation. You can only claim once, so this creates an incentive to hold for as long as possible, and give the project a better chance of success. If someone claims early then the remaining community benefits as the donated tokens are distributed to the remaining Card holders who are "diamond handing".
