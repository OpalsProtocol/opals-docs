A Patron Card is a limited edition digital collectible. They are supply capped to prevent dilution, sold with pricing mechanics to encourage early support. Once they are sold out, they are able to be freely traded on secondary markets prior to project launching a token.

When the project does launch a token, then depending on the projects tokenomics, Patron Cards may be eligible to claim tokens or rewards based on the Card ID number, even if it has been transferred to a cold wallet or sold on the secondary market.

All Patron Cards have a set pricing mechanism when sold through our marketplace, with the first marketplace module being Stepped Pricing, with more pricing mechanisms yet to be released.&#x20;
