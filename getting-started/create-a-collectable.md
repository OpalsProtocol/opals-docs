# Create a Collectable

Once you create a project, you'll need to create a collectable that can be sold. \
\
Go to your project page, as admin, you'll have an extra tab called Studio, where you can create NFTs called [Patron Cards](../key-features/patron-cards.md), that can be sold. The pricing mechanism is [Stepped Pricing](broken-reference), where you can set the number of tokens for sale, at each price. \
\
You can also decide how much of each NFT sale will go towards the project treasury, or the token launcher. You'll need to that more than enough funds are sent to the token launcher to be able to launch, otherwise you'll need to create more NFTs to reach the target. \
\
Be mindful that funds are held in the Marketplace contract until they are sold out. All collectables on Opals offer a 70% money back via an emergency burn. If a collectable is burnt, that card becomes available for sale at the current step price. Once the final step sells out, the funds are split between the projects and the launcher.&#x20;
