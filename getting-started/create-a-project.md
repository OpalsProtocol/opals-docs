# Create a Project

Go to the [Project Creator](https://opals.io/create/project) - [https://opals.io/create/project](https://opals.io/create/project)

You'll ned to first enter basic information about your project and include a banner and icon. The icon is 400x400px and the 1600x900px recommended for the banner

Each project comes with a token that is locked and not transferable. \
You do need to set a price target for when the token it unlocked, and this needs to be set at the start so people can have certainty that this project will automatically launch if its target is reached.\
\
As 10% of the tokens are reserved for the token launcher, when you set a target, the token market cap will be 10x the target. \
\
For example, the launch target is $500k, then the market cap of the token when it is tradable will start at $5mil
